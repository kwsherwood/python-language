A

Round of fiddles playing Bach.
Come, ye daughters, share my anguish Bare arms, black dresses,
See Him! Whom ?
Bediamond the passion of our Lord ,
See Him! How?
His legs blue, tendons bleeding,
o Lamb of God most holy!
Black full dress of the audience.
Dead century, where are your motley
Country people in Leipzig,
Easter,
Matronly flounces , starched, heaving,
Cheeks of the patrons of Leipzig "Going to Church? Where 's the baby?"
"Ah, there's the Kapellmeister
in a terrible hurry Johann Sebastian, twenty-two
children! "
The Passion According to Matthew,
Composed seventeen twenty-nine ,
Rendered at Carnegie Hall,
Nineteen twenty-eight,
Thursday evening, the fifth of April.
The autos parked , honking.

[A-I]

A German lady there said :
(Heart turned to Thee)
"I, too , was born in Arcadia."
The lights dim , and the brain when the flesh dims .
Hats picked up from under seats.
Galleries darkening.
"Not that exit, Sir!"
Ecdysis: the serpent coming out, molting,
As tho blood stained the floor as the foot stepped,
Bleeding chamfer for shoulder:
"Not that exit!"
"Devil! Which?" Blood and desire to graft what you desire,
But no heart left for boys' voices.
Desire longing for perfection.
And as one who under stars
Spits across the sand dunes, and the winds
Blow thru him, the spittle drowning worlds I lit a cigarette, and stepped free
Beyond the red light of the exit.
The usher faded thru "Camel" smoke;
The next person seen thru it,
Greasy, solicitous, eyes smiling minutes after ,
A tramp's face,
Lips looking out of a beard
Hips looking out of ripped trousers
and suddenly
Nothing.
About me, the voices of those who had
been at the concert,

[A-I]

Feet stopping everywhere in the streets,
High necks turned for chatter:
"Poor Thomas Hardy he had to go so soon,
He admired so our recessional architecture What do you think of our new Sherry-Netherland!"
"Lovely soprano,
Is that her mother? lovely lines,
I admire her very much!"
And those who perused the score at the concert,
Patrons of poetry, business devotees of arts and letters,
Cornerstones of waste paper, "Such lyric weather" Chirping quatrain on quatrain;
And the sonneteers - when I consider
again and over again Immured holluschickies persisting thru polysyllables,
Mongers in mystic accretions;
The stealers of "melange adultere de tout,"
Down East, Middle West, and West coast f1aunters
of the Classics and of
Tradition
(A word to them of great contours) Who sang of women raped by horses.
And on one side street near an elevated,
Lamenting,
Foreheads wrinkled with injunctions:
"The Pennsylvania miners were again on the lockout,
We must send relief to the wives and children What's your next editorial about, Carat,
We need propaganda, the thing's
becoming a mass movement."
It was also Passover.

[A-I]

The blood's tide like the music.
A round of fiddles playing
Without effort As into the fields and forgetting to die.
The streets smoothed over as fields,
Not even the friction of wheels,
Feet off ground:
As beyond effort Music leaving no traces,
Not dying, and leaving no traces.
Not boiling to put pen to paper
Perhaps a few things to remember "There are different techniques,
Men write to be read, or spoken,
Or declaimed, or rhapsodized,
And quite differently to be sung";
"I heard him agonizing,
I saw him inside";
"Everything which
We really are and never quite live."
Far into (about three) in the morning,
The trainmen wide awake, calling
Station on station, under earth,

Cold stone above Thy head.
Weary, broken bodies.
Sleeping: their eyes were full of sleep.
The next day the reverses
As if the music were only a taunt:
As if it had not kept, flower-cell, liveforever,
before the eyes, perfecting.

[A-i]

- I thought that was finished:
Existence not even subsistence,
Worm eating the bark of the street tree ,
Smoke sooting skyscraper chimneys,
That which looked for substitutes, tired,
Ready to give up the ghost in a cellar Remembering love in a taxi:
A country of state roads and automobiles,
But great numbers idle, shiftless, disguised on streets The excuse of the experts
'Production exceeds demand so we curtail employment';
And the Wobblies hollering reply,
Yeh, but why don't you give us more than a meal
to increase the consumption!
And the great Magnus, before his confreres in industry,
Swallow tail, eating a sandwich,
"Road map to the stomach," grinning,
Pointing to a chart, between bites.
"We ran 'em in chain gangs, down in the Argentine,
Executive's not the word, use engineer,
Single handed, ran 'em like soldiers,
Seventy-four yesterday, and could run 'em today,
Been fishin' all Easter
Nothin' like nature for hell-fire!"
Dogs cuddling to lamposts,
Maybe broken forged iron,
"Ye lightnings, ye thunders
In clouds are ye vanished?
Open,O fierce flaming pit!"

Half-human, half-equestrian, clatter of waves,
Fabulous sea-horses up blind alleys,
Never appeased , desire to break thru the walls

- Clear music Not calling you names , says Kay,
Poetry is not made of such things ,
Music, itch according to its wonts ,
Snapped old catguts of Johann Sebastian,
Society, traduction twice over.
- Kay , in the sea
There with you,
Slugs, cuttlefish,
Ball of imperialism, wave games, nations,
Navies and armaments, drilling,
Old religions Epos:
One Greek carrying off at least two wives for his
comfort Those epopt caryatids, holding, holding, the
world-cornice.
(Agamemnon). Very much like the sailors.
Lust and lust. Ritornelle .
All! blue trouser seats - each alike a square inch sticking thru portholes,
Laughter, laced blue over torus,
Gibes from the low deck :
"Hi, Ricky!"
(Splash of white pail-wash, scuttling and laughter).
The sea grinds the half-hours,
Each half-hour the bells are heard,

[A-2]

Till the moon, one afternoon,
Launches with sea-whorl,
Opening leaf within leaf floats, green,
On waves : live forever.
Hyaline cushions it, sun,
In one's own head .

of alleyways:

As in Johann Sebastian,
Listen, Kay .. .
The music is in the flower,
Leaf around leaf ranged around the center;
Profuse but clear outer leaf breaking on space,
.
There is space to step to the central heart :
The music is in the flower,
It is not the sea but hyaline cushions the flower _
Liveforever, everlasting.
The leaves never topple from each other,
Each leaf a buttress flung for the other.

Ankle , like fetlock, at the center leaf _
Looked into the mild orbs of the flower,
Eyes drowned in the mild orbs;
Hair falling over ankle, hair falling over forehead,
What is at my lips,
The flower bears rust lightly,
No air stirs, but the music steeps in the center _
It is not the sea, but what floats over it.

I walked on Easter Sunday,
This is my face
This is my form.
Faces and forms , I would write
you down
In a style of leaves growing.
A train crossed the country: (cantata).
A sign behind trees read (blood red as intertwined
Rose of the Passion)
Wrigleys.
Boy and girl with crosses of straw for their nosegays
Impinged upon field as on ocean;
Breath fast as in love's lying close,
Crouched, high - 0 my God, into the flower!
The double chorus singing,
Around Thy tomb here sit we weeping
For the fun of it,
o Saviour blest
The song out of the voices.

At eventide, cool hour
Your dead mouth singing,
Ricky ,
Automobiles speed
Past the cemetery,
No meter turns.
Sleep,
With an open gas range
Beneath for a pillow.
The cat, paw brought back
Over her seat, velvet,
Puss - .
"Who smelt gas?"
" - Would I lie!"
"No crossin' bridges,
Rick'No bridges, not after midnight!"
" - God's gift to woman!"
Out of memory

The song reaches home
'Here are your dead ,

Lion-heart,
A horse bridled -

Not yours A broken stanchion.

Trappings rise ,
Princelet
Out of history .

Of leaves,
Lion-heart, my dove ,
Pansy over the heart , dicky-bird.'

Trappings
Rise and surround
Two dark heads,
Dead, straight foreheads,
The beautiful
Almost sexual
Brothers.

Giant sparkler,
Lights of the river,
(Horses turning)
Tide,
And pier lights
Under a light of the hill,
A lamp on the leaf-green
Lampost seen by the light
Of a truck (a song)
Lanterns swing behind horses,
Their sides gleam
From levels of water Wherever we put our hats is our home
Our aged heads are our homes,
Eyes wink to their own phosphorescence,
No feast lights of Venice or The Last Supper light
Our beards' familiars; His
Stars of Deuteronomy are with us,
Always with us,
We had a Speech, our children have
evolved a jargon.
We prayed, Open, God, Gate of Psalmody,

[A-4]

I2

That our Psalms may reach but
One shadow of Your light ,
That You may see a minute over our waywardness.
Day You granted to Your seed, its promise, Its
Promise,
Do not turn away Your sun.
Let us rest here ,
lightened
Of our tongues, hands, feet, eyes , ears and hearts.
Fierce Ark!
Gold lion stomach
(Red hair in intaglio)
Dead loves stones of our Temple walls,
Ripped up pebble-stones of our tessellation,
Split cedar chest harboring our Law,
Even the Death has gone out of us - we are void.
Hear He calleth for Elias A clavicembalo!

Deafen us, God , deafen us to their music,
Our own children have passed over to the ostracized,
They assail us 'Religious, snarling monsters' And have mouthed a jargon:/
"Rain blows, light, on quiet water
I watch the rings spread and travel
Shimaunu-San, Samurai,
When will you come home? Shimaunu-San, my clear star.

To-day I gather all red flowers,

I3

[A-4]

Shed their petals on the paths,
Shimaunu-San, in the dawn,
Red I go to meet him Shimaunu-San, my clear star.
To-morrow I tear cherry sprays,
Wreathe them in my hair and at my
temples,
Shimaunu-San will see my head's white
blossoms,
In the dark run towards me
Shimaunu-San, my clear star.
All turtle-doves have pledged
To fly and search him:
Shimaunu-San, at my little windows
Each night a tiny candle will be
lighted Shimaunu-San, my clear star."

Yehoash.
Song's kinship,
The roots we strike.
"Heavier from day to day
Grow my limbs with sap of forests"

Bestower Of man and tree and sand,
When your face upon the land
Flames in last redness, allow me of your
light- "
My father's precursors
Set masts in dinghies , chanted the Speech.
"Wider is the ash around the fire"
"Treasures turned to sand"

Yehoash, The courses we tide from.
Tree of the Bach family
Compiled by Sebastian himself.
, Veit Bach, a miller in Wechmar,
Delighted most in his lute
Which he brought to the mill
And played while it was grinding.
A pretty noise the pair must have made,
Teaching him to keep time.
But, apparently, that is how
Music first came into our family!'

"Deep roots hammer lower"
"And to the Sun, I bow.
On the gray mountains,
Where multiply
The stairs of crags, my prayer
Will follow you, still Heir -

A carousel - Flour runs.
Song drifts from the noises.
"My petted birds are dead."
"I will gather a chain

Never a memory remain."

An animate still-life - night.
Leaves, autumn .
Thread the middle.
A cigarette,
Leaf-edge, burning
obliquely urban,

the branches of trees air
comfort.
Kay : The heart has the imagination,
In case of emergency follow the next lunatic.
I: Ask Faust, the reason we're not further along Go-ethe, alias MacFadden He-er vent Hel-ee-na squat from our sidewalks.
One's thought
And past the leafs edge
(Not in the central heart)
Our voices :
"How? without roots?"
" I have said The courses we tide from ."
"They are then a light matter?"
"Let it go at that , they are a light matter."
"Isn't it more?" "As you say ."
"Your people?" "All people ."

"You write a strange speech." "This."
One song
Of many voices :
The words Matthew weeps
(Plaint, clavicembalo) Chorale, the kids in the loft
(0 love untold, love lying close);
Or say, words have knees
water's in them, all joints crack, (New York , tonight , the rat-lofts
light
with the light of a trefoil) ;
Purple clover,
She wore her shoes three years (The soles new as the sunned black
of her grave-turf) ;
Speech bew~Jling a Wall ,
Night of economic extinctions
Death's encomium And leaves blowing over and over.
For I have seen self-taunt
tracked down in the mirror,
And besides it, asleep, the face open,
Edges of no one like it: Everlasting.

A field behind brick wall , painted
with gigantic green elves, Wrigleys in
rubric "Eveline! Eveline!" - Madam ,
As against the Fine Arts' Dogma
The sad clothes line , or
Your laundered conception
of the B.V.D.
Have seen:
That day ,
And the Jews eating unleavened bread ;
Ramshackle field-weed ; " - Lie down
I'll marry you!"

The answer:
Do you think we are sailors?
New are, the trees,
Purple in the violets' swath,
Birds - birds - birds,
Against bark a child's forehead
tormented red,
(No glasses between eyes and bark)
Face to bark.
The answer:

And one afternoon : a field,
Two windows spacing a wall,
A heavy bulk move back of
the windows-

[A-51

Under sky
The winds breathe in the fields.
Standing there chest to chest,

One horse
Walked off,
The trees showing sunlight
Sunlight trees,
Words ranging forms.

Environs, the sea of - ,
Grace notes, appoggiatura, suspension,
The small note with or without a stroke across the stem;
Beata Virgo Maria, when sunlight
Runs over Mrs. Green, may ever
Her enormous kindness bellow
To her daughter: "Eveline!"
Jesus bless, too, that lady's avoirdupois
Great as of outlasting song,
Also her tiny daughter hoiden
Outwriggling the wriggly Wrigley boys.
And those loved seeking their own completion in a
voice, their own voice sounding
Melody, sequence
o head, think, how climbing, you would be;
o heart,
how
the
blood
And the measures (travel outward)
Should travel together;
The mutual slap comes suddenly
After tiredness between people,
Everything lowered to a mutual, common level,
Everyone the same,

[A-5]

20

21

[A-6]

Each, at best, obbligato to the other,
Everyone tired of trying to see differences,
Crosses or uncrossed ,
Practicing word sleight 'The sea of necessity , yes,
That stem Atlas carrying his on his shoulder
Should know nothing less than a lightning rod,
Way up , don't ask me where' Saying, It's a hard world anyway,
Not many of us will get out of it alive .
But who would say If this world, the sources,
Fathers, wherever they put their hats,
Spiralled with tessellation as sands of the sea,
The Speech no longer spoken and not even a Wall
to worship,
Holy, laundered into a blank and washed over
Tradition's pebbles, the mouth full,
The fugue a music heap,
only by the name's grace music
(Fate - fate - fate - void
unable to write
a melodyLudwig and Goethe of one century,
Forms only in snatches,
Words rangeless, melody forced by writing,
Walk, as arms beat in circles, past each other) -

Natura Naturata Nature as created.
He who creates
Is a mode of these inertial systems The flower - leaf around leaf wrapped
around the center leaf,
Environs - the sea,
The ears, doors ;
The wordsLost - visible.
Asked Albert who introduced relativity "And what is the formula for success?"
"X=work, y=play, Z=keep your mouth
shut."
"What about Johann Sebastian? The same
formula."
The song - omits?
No, includes Kay, Anybody.
Ricky's romance
Of twenty-three years, in
Detail, continues
He - a- pyjamas off Invites ants upon his ankle
Up-up, ta-ta,
minus, but quite there :

Would you persist?
"I beg your pardon
I've a- "h" begins the rhyme here,
Shall we now?"

Natura Naturans Nature as creator,

"You misconstrue - uh
Men's rue - eh,
Anyhow!"
The sailors in the carousel
looking for a place to
bury - Ricky;
Seaweed, fellow voters, and
spewn civic sidewalks.
Thus one modernizes
His lute,
Not in one variation after another;
Words form a new city,
Ours is no Mozart's
Magic Flute Tho his melody made up for a century
And, we know, from him, a melody resolves
to no dullness But when we push up the daisies,
The melody! the rest is accessory:
My one voice. My other: is
An objective - rays of the object brought to a focus,
An objective - nature as creator - desire
for what is objectively perfect
Inextricably the direction of historic and
contemporary particulars.

I .S.B.: a particular,
His Matthew Passion, a particular,
And that other century
Mentioned thru trains' run over trestle

one Easter Sunday :
"Napoleon filled a barrel with rams horns
And sent it to Italy. The Great Boot
Filled a barrel with It's hard to say - parts - the men of parts
All but their parts out of the barrel
And sent it to Napoleon Stressing, 'This is what we did to your soldiers!"
And that's history, contention,
A cheeseless mousetrap. Fills up spaced paper."
Another kind of particular.
We are after all realists capable of distinctions.
"Many people are too busy to be unemployed," says
Henry.
(Especially those who have their own factories
to take care of.)
"If communism ever gets into a country
And raises Ned with it,
lt's because that country needs it.
Only about one family
In ten has a bathtub.
They should be made cheaper,
So that everybody could have them.
If goods don't sell,
It's because they're no good
Or are too high priced."
(Disposed of: the short change of labor.)
As for labor,
"There are more people
Who won't try to do anything,"
Says Henry ,
"Than there are who don't know what to do,
I am in the business of making automobiles

25

[A-6]

Because I believe I can do more good that way
Than any other.
Industry itself is a part of culture .
The fact that a man knows a lot
About industry does not prevent
His using good grammar,
Standing straight and appearing well.
We need beauty in everything, and culture
Should be a thing of practice,
Not something apart.
Everything should be a thing of beauty,
Well made and well thought out."
Spilt from the running-board, Ricky! The buildings rise on the heights,
Turrets with windows delight
The ladies garnered in tights
Of crimson tinseled with
white.
History: the records of taste and economy of a
civilization.
Particular: Every fall season, every spring, he needs
a new coat
He loses his job Poetry? it has something to do with his writing of
poetry.
"That's poetry," he was told.
"It's fiction, too, isn't it," said Henry,
"I read poetry, and I enjoy it
If it says anything,
But so often it doesn't say anything."
The common air includes

[A-6]

Events listening to their own tremors,
Beings and no more than breath
between them,
Histories, differences, walls,
And the words which bind them no more than
"So that," "and" The thought in the melody moves A line, flash of photoplay.
"When you're phosphates,
They'll look you up and discover J. S. B. was a Latin instructor Some individual you were!",
Croaked Mr. Anybody.
Tastes : Men of forty kiddin' themselves in blue overalls,
With little blue and red trucks.
Septuagenarian actor's personal locomotive
For retired estate which his boy day dreams realized.
De gustibus bespeaks ... the sparrow . .. pecking
at something unmentionable .
To find a thing, all things.
On that morning when everything
will be clear,
Greeting myself, despite glasses,
The world's earth a rose,
rose every particle
The palm open,
earth's lily ,
One will see
gravel in gravel

27

[A-6]

Stray bits
of burnt matches
Glass,
disused rubber,
Scrape heels of shoes,
and not trip,
Not that one will get, see
more than particulars,

Rest Thee softly, softly rest.
Preparing to receive the captain of industry,
Emptied a full wardrobe and, after he came,
Said - "My dear Magnus, here, entirely to yourself,
's a closet for your suspenders."
The time was By Mazola, on Riverside Drive The heyday of revivals of western movies,
After the cowboys
Who did their darnest, angels, could do no more.
Seriously,
The young lady, remorseful, having brought scandal
On the family by taking to smoking
Wore the gray stockings again she had always been
wearing lately.
And the time was:
The gun shoots - go!
Clory of the Seas by Free Wash out of Tan Seamen,
vs. Temper Awake by Splashed out of Sleep,
Dogs - I'll grant you dogs But a horse,
That's an animal!

[A-6]

The time was:
The same woman, cries the kid,
With the same dog, and
The same man! - gaging her speed.
The time was Arcy Bell:
A nigger
Had a city and a country home
And a rabbit patch on which
he 'conveniently did shoot them'
In the few hours we were not worked
in the Post Office together,
He and I and Van - with his projection of
forehead Dutch, flaxen, slight, plus inherited New England
seafaring suavity "I dreamt that I tickled my grandfather's aw-awls,
With the oi-oi-Iy edge of a feather!
Arcy agin' the wall!
Shoot high yaller
Agin' the wall!"
And it was to the glory of Liza - Arcy's And Eliza Jane, his friend's wife
who was invited only with her husband,
That they paired off always
As individual families,
Having taken over standards that would
Have been impoliteness to Eskimos.
Seriously: As serious as
F our and a half decades kiddin' himself on a

[A-6]

miniature golf-course.
I tell you this man had vistas : Ties, handkerchiefs to watch,
Mufflers, dress shirts, golf holes,
Chocolate eclaires, automobiles and entrees.
Played polo.
And the - the - the very old stutterers, mumbletypeg
in duplex Park Av. apartments,
Mumbling imperceptibly when the jack-knife stuck
twenty-five dollar shoe leather.
Their children got jobs because "they didn't believe in
Santa Claus,"
Said Henry, "good boys, Uncle Magnus, they come of
good families!"
The time was 'heretical,'
The Church identified with aesthetics,
The heretics sought perfection, Blessed Virgin Mary, as tho
your lips were made out of lipstick,
Their logic the height of your pregnancy.
But, naturally, they were offended for all religions
At the time the Cross heaps were blasted in Moscow.
"It is more pleasant and more useful,"
Said Vladimir Ilytch,
"To live thru the experience
Of a revolution
Than to write about it."

The women held the world cornice,
The Red Army was buttressed by women.
The star, Venus, bathed
In the sunsets

Mars
Bloody
Tinkered with the other
Stars.

An accent, not anyone nation's
Evidently a matter to attract the next diner.
Not royalty, but faces hollowed as royalty,
A passion growing urban as in Greece, A vague dream, - standing each other to drinks,
Aging eyes, impish, overhanging
Carafes on bars
Under leaves serrated in falls,
And at theatricals.
The hands wandering over each other,
A hole and entered.
And above terraces of the city, a hill,
Night, Aldebaran,
Young, no differences in ages, a hole.
'Disturbed?' 'What's in the underbrush?' A white rabbit
Plumped on his belly, Reassured. Thru trees,
White teeth perhaps
Laughed ...

The time was :
He had worked enough in his pa's wheatfields,
And gone to the State University,
And now participated with the angels in Paris.

[A-6]

The time was :
12 years after Ilytch's statement
When the collectivists
Raised the great metallurgical plants
In Siberia,
For a people's idea,
As well as their practice;
Tariffs;
The U. S. A. embargo
On pulp-wood from Russia,
Tho the U. S. A. needed the pulp-wood.
If there must be nations, why not
Make it clear they're for business?
"We've got to find new uses for wheat," said Henry;
The time was when its shipment would

"You see this road thru the desert,
They call it a highway .
The Lincoln highway.
It's time this country forked up
Coin for roads.
They could if they didn't have prohibition :
See this spittoon,
Empty it and there's nothin' in it;
The Treasury is like a spittoon,
Except that you've got to fill it with taxes ;
So there's no reason why the poor purchaser
Shouldn't have his swig as another."
Was advised:
"It's to laugh
Bust up automobile parts I had 'em during the war, Henry didn't Just gravy , Did I care?
I had 'em, kept 'em
Till they wanted 'em. You bet they wanted 'em.
But in peace times
You've got to use things,
Keep 'em in circulation,
If I ain't got it, the other fellow has. Yes, I'm retired."

See him! How ? Against wood his body close,
Speaks: My face at where its forehead might be,

Choose Jews' shoes or whose: anyway Choose! Go!

Birds- birds- nozzle of horse, washed plank in air. ..
For they had no manes we would give them manes,
For their wood was dead the wood would move - bare
But for the print on it - for diggers gone, trains'
Run , light lights in air where the dead reposed As many as take live forever , "Street Closed."

But they had no eyes, and their legs were wood!
But their stomachs were logs with print on them!
Blood red, red lamps hung from necks or where could
Be necks, two legs stood A, four together M They had no manes so there were no airs, but Butt ... butt ... from me to pit no singing gut!

"Closed"? then fellow me airs, We'll open ruts

Switch is a whip which never has been, cuts
Winds for words - Turf streams words, airs untraced

But the graves were turfed and the horses grassed Two voices: - Airs? No birds. Taxi? No air -

Says you! Then I, Singing, It is not the sea
But what floats over: hang from necks or where could
Be necks, blood red, red lamps (Night), Launder me ,
Mary! Sea of horses that once were wood,
Green and, and leaf on leaf, and dancing bucks,
Who take liveforever! Taken a pump
And shaped a flower. "Street Closed" on their stomachs.
But the street has moved; at each block a stump
That blossoms red, And I sat there, no one
Asked me, nor asked you. Whom? You were not there.
A sign creaked - LAUNDRY TO-LET - (creaked wind -) - SUN-

To provide the two Choirs the work demanded
He employed his chorus primus and chorus
secundus
Choruses comparatively simple,
Within the competence of singers
Not called on to sing figural music ,
The Thomaskirche could provide the two organs
the score prescribes ,
(The larger, in the west gallery, a two-manual
instrument)
Two orchestras composed of the town's musicians,
Players in the Thomasschule, University studiosi,
And members of Bach's Collegium Musicum

"Pray we our Lord"
High officials and well-born ladies,
With devotion,
joining to sing the first Choral from their
books:
But as the theatrical music proceeded "What does it all mean?"
One old lady, a widow: 'God help us!
'Tis surely a comic-Opera!'
'Natural that Bach should enjoy himself,
Had of course to play his music in church'
And out of respect for what he said about Bach
and the need for amusement in church,
,
One would salute with two fingers,
Out of respect (tho one has known respect
before)
two fingers:
which
Touch, sign from, the forehead,
The personal clarity, after the voice known
has spoken.
"How journeyed?"
Journeyed.
With impulse to master
music and related matters.

never really,
Kept quick notations for cages of song,
Peered thru the cages to see the yellow,

To hear sounds sweeter than by day,

By day already exceeded by the instant.

Not Joh. Seb. Bach, Director Musices:
A short and much-needed statement of the
requirements of church
music. With some general reflections
on its decline:
To perform concerted music as it should be
rendered,
both singers and instrumentalists are required.
no one cares to work for nothing.
in the chorus secundus I am obliged to use
scholars otherwise available
beneficia, themselves inconsiderable, formerly
available for the chorus musicus have
been withdrawn.
It is astonishing that. . musicians should
be expected
to play ex tempore any music put before
them,
.. the necessity to earn their. . bread
allowing them little leisure to perfect their
technique,
.. observe how the royal musicians.. are paid.

Friends too tired to see differences,
This, Marx dissociated:
"Equal right .. presupposes inequality,
Different people are not equal one to another."
But to make the exploitation by one man of many
impossible!
When the opposition between brain and manual work
will have disappeared,

[A-8]

When labor will have ceased to be a mere means of
supporting life,
Whether it was 'impossible for matter to think?'
Duns Scotus posed.
Unbodily substance is an absurdity
like unbodily body. It is impossible
to separate thought and matter that thinks.
"Described," in Das Kapital, "large-scale industry
Not only as the mother of antagonism, but as the
producer
Of the material and spiritual conditions for resolving
that antagonism .
It is true the solution cannot proceed along pleasant
lines."

Infinite is a meaningless word : except - it states
The mind is capable of performing
an endless process of addition.
Who by construction have
A bird settling like a leaf
Will bury Lord Jesu
For labor who will sing

Is strength enough?

Should have one constant: Name? - perhaps Energy.

To this end, Communists assembled in London
Sketched the Manifesto of the party itself.
Hidden , open fIght - to date that is history:
Exploiting and exploited. When in the ice-age
A pipe made of a lion's tooth played D and G,
Or when glass harmonica or dining table
Tuned their glass (plunged tones) there was history
(movement
In excavations) an economy that is,
Which was the material clef of the music .
A column against which the whole ensemble leans
Should the struck bars of oblong glass be stopped a void
To be felt (Why does Monsieur P. talk about God) The music brings up a vacuum thru which light
Travels - (as a hesitant voice comes up to fact)
Light-wave and quantum, we have good proof both exist :
Our present effort is to see how this is : to
Perfect the composition of a two-point view,
The economists have a similar problem.
Light above shifting heads, inertia of light.
Thought is weightless but is stopped by a bullet, what?
Call its quick , least particle a system of waves,

Build it. Designate by \{I that "something," changes
In which trident stay responsible for the waves,
Thought has assumed what thought is compelled to
assume!
Bearings, a choice of facts, impetus imparted
By conflict; history does not begin again
When a thought trains on the fact that begins again.

When the sheriffe see gentle Robin wold shoote, held
Up both his hands. As defeats gaged economies,
Lags when gallows looped distance , the Manifesto :
That quantum of the means of subsistence which leaves
No surplus to command the labor of others,
The Communists see no need to abolish that ,
Growth of industry is destroying it daily;
You must allow by "individual" is meant
Middle-class owner, not nine-tenths of the people .
I saw my lady weep, the glass harmonica
Stilled - society splitting into two camps, two
Classes, light but the common's sun, with Elberfeld's

Million tons of coal fall past the past down the chutes
Leashed to capital; ash-heaps; Viollet-le-Duc's
Guess-edifices of steel, stone sheathes preserving
Them - built as guessed. Silver slipped across the
chasm. Light?
What is light? physicists failed. Gold? politics' light.
All one's best citizens the banks , - the first May Day
Who had whistled? The scale fell as the pail emptied.
Can the middle-classes pay the scale, play the scale?
What do you think - with the state's gold safe in
a vault
To be flooded in case of war? I asked the boss
Why my crops were his. He said the coal bill; you took
Off the Fourth of July . Subdivided shops, fire
Hazards. The evicted dawdle, the shots hit home.
My kid's bare as a plucked bird's hole in whistling time.
Proletarians massed on each nation's curtain
Of fire , fighting to stop the haggling of nations,
The void fills, the music of old glass is playing new

And made small children gasp
And hide their faces in their mothers' shawls

But the labor process Consider the labor process apart
From its particular form under particular
social conditions.
What distinguishes any worker from the best
of the bees
Is that the worker builds a cell in his head
before he constructs it in wax.
The labor process ends in the creation of a thing,
Which when the process began
Already lived as the worker's image.
And he realizes his own purpose
To which he gives up his will.
Nor does he give it up to the crick of
a second
But the less attractive he finds the work in itself,
The less it frees him body and mind The more is his care glued to the grind.
Spins and the product is his web

of clocks :
It would be possible to show from the development
of the clock
How entirely different the relation between theoretical
learning
And practice was in the handicraft,
From what it is in large-scale industry.

The clock and the corn-mill
(The water-mill , that is ,)
The clock, the idea of applying automatic device
(Moved by springs) to production.
The mill the essential organism of a machine:
The mechanical driving power; the transmitting
mechanism; the working machine ,
Which deals with the material. Each
With an existence independent of the others.
The mathematicians, so far as they occupied themselves
With practical mechanics and its theoretical side,
Started from the simple corn-grinding water-mill.
The actual work . . beating, crushing, grinding,
pulverisation ..
Was performed from the first without human labor
Even tho the moving force was human or animal.
This kind of machinery is therefore very ancient,
At least in its origins, and
Actual mechanical propulsion was
formerly applied to it.

Go where (not alive on the running-board) Trappings rise No bridges, no breeches, not after midnight.
Go (as quick as the news-print turns yellow) as
The Araucanian Indians' sacred tree Canelo
Shipped from Chile to the U. S. A.
And back again to Chile:
After the khaki inspectors of the American
Department of Agriculture
Peered six month at the plant, it withered
To a few dusty stalks
In Washington's Indian summer, District of Columbia.
Go with the ghost's arm of a dead friend
in a coat sleeve,
Spring rain on his face Who had picked snails and made chowder,
Dark hair gilding from the sea chlorine,
The salt evaporating on the body in small crystals.
Leg casts of sand on the ghost,
Tinker with machines
After pressing comfortably upside down on your groin
in the dunes A voice craves perfection:
'our age in our wrists
use 'em for levers'.

Wrestling with body smell Sunset - green waves - the meadow lark
at the bayberry's end Spray of the Atlantic dashed in

Digging - we are singing of gardens - March
Day of equal night, Bach's chorus primus
To chorus secundus to the groined arch To vanish as the cone fruit of the larch:
Voice a voice blown, returning as May, dew
On night grass : and he said I worked hard, hue
Of word on the melody , (each note worth
Thought the clatter of a water-mill drew) :
Labor, light lights in air, on earth, in earth.

Labor, light lights in air, on earth, in earth.

Coda, see to it the burden renew ,
Sound out thick gardens dug up in purlieu
The shrapnel haunts; May is red blossom, berth
Of what times' mill ; blood reads the wounds, the cue Luteclavicembalo - bullets pursue:
Labor light lights in earth, in air, on earth.

Tossed coins in herrings heads, what journey thru

Plays till four notes give out their names: old Bach's

Of surplus value, disparate decision.

An impulse to action sings of a semblance
Of things related as equated values,
The measure all use is time congealed labor
In which abstraction things keep no resemb\ance
To goods created; integrated all hues
Hide their natural use to one or one's neighbor.
So that were the things words they could say: Light is
Like night is like us when we meet our mentors
Use hardly enters into their exchanges,
Bought to be sold things, our value arranges;
We flee people who made us as a right is
Whose sight is quick to choose us as frequenters,
But see our centers do not show the changes
Of human labor our value estranges.

Values in series taking on as real
We affect ready gold a steady token
Flows in unbroken circuit and induces
Our being, wearies of us as ideal
Equals that heady crises eddy. Broken
Mentors, unspoken wealth labor produces,
Now loom as causes disposing our loci,
The foci of production : things reflected
As wills subjected; formed in the division
Of labor, labor takes on our imprecision Bought, induced by gold at no gain, though close eye
And gross sigh fixed upon gain have effected
Value erected on labor, prevision

[A-9]

I06

Hands, heart, not value made us, and of any
Desired perfection the projection solely,
Lives worked us slowly to delight the senses,
Of their fire shall you find us, of the many
Acts of direction not defection - wholly
Dead labor, lowlier with time's offeI1ses,
Assumed things of labor powers extorted
So thwarted we are together impeded The labor speeded while our worth decreases Naturally surplus value increases
Being incident to the pace exhorted:
Unsorted, indrawn, but things that time ceded
To life exceeded - not change, the mind pieces
The expanse of labor in us when it ceases.

Light acts beyond the phase day wills us into
Call a maturer day, the poor are torn - a
Pawl to adorn a ratchet - hope dim - eying
Move cangues, conjoined the coils of things they thin to,
With allayed furor the obscurer bourne, a
Stopped hope unworn, a voiced look, mask espying
That, as things, men want in us yet behoove us,
Disprove us least as things of light appearing
To the will gearing to light's infinite locus:
Not today but tomorrow is their focus.
No one really knows us who does not prove us,
None or times move us but that we wake searing
The labor veering from guises which cloak us,
As animate instruments men invoke us.

I07

[A-9]

Dissemble - pledging complexions so guarded Cast of plied error leaves such error asserted
But stand obverted, men sight us things joined to
Change itself edging the full light discarded In machines' terror a use there averted Times have subverted the plenty they point to :
Things, we have not always known this division Misprision of interest, profit, rent - coded
Surplus, decoded as labor - evaded
As gain the source of all wealth so degraded
The land and the worker elude the vision A scission of surplus and use corroded
And still, things goaded by labor, nor faded,
But like light in which its action was aided.

We are things, say, like a quantum of action
Defined product of energy and time, now
In these words which rhyme now how song's exaction
Forces abstraction to turn from equated
Values to labor we have approximated.

An eye to action sees love bear the semblance
Of things, related is equated, - values
The measure all use who conceive love, labor
Men see, abstraction they feel, the resemblance
(Part, self-created, integrated) all hues
Show to natural use, like Benedict's neighbor
Crying his hall's flown into the bird: Light is
The night isolated by stars (poled mentors)
Blossom eyelet enters pealing with such changes
As sweet alyssum, that not-madness, (ranges
In itself, there tho acting without right) is -

[A-9]

108

Whose sight is rays, "I shall go; the frequenters
That search our centers, love ; Elysium exchanges
No desires; its thought loves what hope estranges."

Such need may see reason, the perfect real A body ready as love's steady token
Fed thought unbroken as pleasure induces True to thought wearies never its ideal
That loves love, head, every eddy. Broken
Plea, best unspoken, a lip's change produces
Suffers to confuse this thought and its loci,
The foci of things timelessly reflected Substance subjected to no human prevision,
Free as exists it loves: worms dig; imprecision
Of indignation cannot make the rose high
Or close sigh, therein blessedness effected
Thru power has directed love to envision
Where body is it bears a like decision.

Virtue flames value, merriment love - any
Compassed perfection a projection solely
Power, the lowly do not tune the senses;
More apt, more salutary body moves many
Minds whose direction makes defection wholly
Vague. This sole lee is love: from it offences
To self or others die, and the extorted
Word, thwarted dream with eyes open; impeded
Not by things seeded from which strength increases;
Remindful of its deaths as loves decreases;
Happy with the dandelion unsorted,
Well-sorted by imagination speeded
To it, exceeded night lasts, the sun pieces

109

[A-9]

Its necessary nature, error ceases.

Love acts beyond the phase day wills it into Hate is obscure, errs, is pain, furor, torn - a
Lust to adorn aversion, hope - love eying
Its object joined to its cause, sees path into
Things the future or now, that poorer bourne, a
Past, a step, a worn , a voiced look, gone - eying
These , each in itself is saying, "behoove us,
Disprove us least as things of love appearing
In a wish gearing to light's infinite locus,
Balm or jewelweed is according to focus.
No one really knows us who does not love us,
Time does not move us, we are and love, searing
Remembrance - veering from guises which cloak us,
So defined as eternal, men invoke us."

Sweet alyssum sometimes is not of time; now
Weep , love's heir, rhyme now how song's exaction
Is your distraction - related is equated,
How else is love's distance approximated."

A wise man pledging piety unguarded
Lives good not error. By love's heir are asserted
Song, light obverted to mind, joy enjoined to
Least death, act edging patience, envy discarded;
Difficult rare excellence , love's heir, averted
Loss seize the hurt head Apollo's eyes point to :
Ai, Ai Hyacinthus, the petals in vision The scission living acquiescence , coded
Tempers decoded for friendship, evaded
Image recurring to vigilance, raided
By falsehood burning it clear to the vision,
Derision transmuted by laughter, goaded
Voice holding the node at heart, song, unfaded
Understanding whereby action is aided .

Love speaks : "in wracked cities there is less action,

Than to abet murder
In all countries at war
or not yet at war
The depraved fearing for their estates
The old betrayers, corrugate patriots
"For Labor, Family and Country"
Under their breaths
Slavery Penury Ruin
Harrowing workers

Till the country has no defense
Driving both aliens and citizens under dive bombers
Herding peasants into firing onslaught of tanks
Plotting plebiscites migrations
Hunger for all but themselves
Moving entire cities to certain death
Shadowing lives everywhere
with spies, laws, tests, and the last mark,
final zero of death

Incarnate
Carcass smiles
Corpses block the bridges
Machine gun outposts smell of
Dead gunners piled sandbags now
Exported here the Japanese textile girls
will have nothing to gain
No more than at home have the geishas
For rivers to flow with brandy
Peace is ruptured

No slant-eyed devil on stilts
Drunk the Japanese invader fights
Brothers Chinese
Rising Sun roosts also at home
Night dawn noon evening
Chinese murder Chinese
French and British concessioners consort
with Japanese greed
Betrayals bankers' wars from across seas
To gain the scorched earth of China

Populace piled into brushwood burnt alive
Driven up forested mountain tops
Set afire from below go into earth

And the Japanese into the earth

The snake
Rings communications
shames birds
Sucks loyal men eggs
Anti-semites in Italy once
people scarcely civilized hostile to Jews
In Berlin "clear street" is the signal to loot
The tailor's dummy hat on
Hangs with a rope around its neck

Cowardice swells its new Axis

Mussolini's mouth over the people of Italy
Hoarse throat of the German Reich
Rasp on the free body of Spain
With their aim London
With their aim Paris
With their aim the United States
With their aim The International Brigade

Spain
The first sample of lightning attack
Victim of world centers looking away
Four columns of the enemy converged on Madrid
One column of the enemy
Blistered inside
Teruel Guernica chUff into earth
In Barcelona the bombs heavier than
ever in war
Craters of earth
Three raids by seaplanes an hour flared

German, caterpillars
Crawl with ideals of endless chains
Feet trap all
Air traps all
So the Czechs can go back to the Reich
So the Esthonian Baltic Germans
will come back into German earth
for all time out of memory
And the Pole go into the earth

hunted shake off the smell
Not on Switzerland's borders
Not in Paris saved for the Reich

It feels them with a heavy paw
The spittle dribbles from its jaw
He mires their bleeding overalls
The loveliest of animals

The Giver of life makes the dying come
There's nothing like it
To the bombed districts under the
stringed lights of the bombers
Their super-sights
From which nations are running
All resemblance to what lives or is dead
coincident with thoughts not waiting for tears
Let a better time say
The poet stopped singing to talk

Love moved to earth cannot agree
with death
Nor as you know Molotov
Can treaties last an age
With the conquering Idea
unconquered.

He can shoot
Who could not take life

He will hunt the Rhino
Before death

The Rhino is a lovely beast
He has two horns or one at least
And neither horn is just a horn
Provoking a dictator's scorn
His surest backside venting scorn
He sits upon the Rhino's horn
And corporate spumes up a yeast
The Rhino such a lovely beast

Empaled beneath the Rhino's knee
People foul in its wet majesty

Holy
Holy is Sylvie
A little girl
Paul and Helene's daughter
It is her name
She said in French
"Le jour est deja fini
C'est la nuit qui tombe
Et les poupettes
qui attrapent froid
On les en terre
Et on leur chante"

And in English
"Day is over now
It is night that falls
And the dolls

We bury them
And sing to them"

There is a port in Canada
called Ferry End
Glasses clink
Ale is the language
"La fentHre" offers the British tar treating
"0. K.!" agrees the French sailor
"La fenetre?" solicits the Briton
Considering both glasses
The mate/at raises his empty, "O.K!"

Lord

earth is full of Sylvie's glory.

We border on Canada
Nothing there but by labor
Or the Indian will wait till he
digs us up.

Go ahead Paris

There'll be famine next winter

The child hiding
Against the wall
Steals an egg
He wants to fry it
He can't diet
On a knife

The capital of France is Vichy

Blessed is the new age-old effervescence

Till the sailors who mistook their planet
for a light
And took the wrong soundings
Come back

And the people
Grant us the people's peace.

"Why not kill Eugene's rabbit
and serve it for supper?"
Eugene, 12, hears
His body hangs from a belt
Around his neck and the stair railing

Sun and a bird busy Between shutter and blind
Yellow thread

Has no carriage in which to ride
No, not a horse
She doesn't run of course

Live our desires lead us to honor.

for Celia and Paul

River that must turn full after I stop dying
Song, my song, raise grief to music
Light as my loves' thought, the few sick
So sick of wrangling: thus weeping,
Sounds of light, stay in her keeping
And my son's face - this much for honor.

Freed by their praises who make honor dearer
Whose losses show them rich and you no poorer
Take care, song, that what stars' imprint you mirror
Grazes their tears; draw speech from their nature or
Love in you - faced to your outer stars - purer
Gold than tongues make without feeling
Art new, hurt old: revealing
The slackened bow as the stinging
Animal dies, thread gold stringing
The fingerboard pressed in my honor.

Graced, your heart in nothing less than in death, go I, dust - raise the great hem of the extended
World that nothing can leave; having had breath go
Face my son, say: 'If your father offended
You with mute wisdom, my words have not ended
His second paradise where
His love was in her eyes where
They turn, quick for you two - sick
Or gone cannot make music
You set less than all. Honor

His voice in me , the river's turn that finds the
Grace in you, four notes first too full for talk, leaf
Lighting stem, stems bound to the branch that binds
the
Tree, and then as from the same root we talk, leaf
After leaf of your mind's music, page, walk leaf
Over leaf of his thought, sounding
His happiness: song sounding
The grace that comes from knowing
Things, her love our own showing
Her love in all her honor.'

Honor, song, sang the blest is delight knowing
We overcome ills by love. Hurt, song, nourish
Eyes, think most of whom you hurt. For the flowing
River's poison where what rod blossoms. Flourish
By love's sweet lights and sing in them I flourish.
No, song, not anyone power
May recall or forget, our
Love to see your love flows into

Or in the heart or in the head?
Quire after over three millenia.

A year, a month and 19 days before the void in effect -

Out of deep need
Four trombones and the organ in the nave
A torch surged Timed the theme Bach's name,
Dark, larch and ridge, night:
From my body to other bodies
Angels and bastards interchangeably
Who had better sing and tell stories
Before all will be abstracted.
So goes: first, shape
The creation A mist from the earth,
The whole face of the ground;
Then rhythm And breathed breath of life;
Then styleThat from the eye its function takes "Taste" we say - a living soul.
First, glyph; then syllabary,
Then letters. Ratio after
Eyes, tale in sound. First, dance. Then
Voice. First, body - to be seen and to pulse
Happening together.
Before the void there was neither
Being nor non-being;
Desire, came warmth ,
Or which, first?
Until the sages looked in their hearts

[A-12]

126

Sense sure, else not motion,
Madness to ecstasy never so thralled
But showed some quantity of choice
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope
Who tells time on all fours, yet moves
Shape, love sense and openhandedness
Blest
Ardent
good,
Celia,
speak simply, rarely
scarce, seldom Happy, immeasurable love
heart or head's greater part unhurt and happy ,
things that bear harmony
certain in concord with reason.

From the spring of Art of Fugue:
The parts of a fugue should behave like reasonable men
in an orderly discussion
From the source of A Midsummer-Night's Dream :

127

[A-12]

How comes this gentle concord in the world?
Paul
The order that rules music, the same
controls the placing of the stars and the feathers
in a bird 's wing.
In the middle of harmony
Most heavenly music
For the universe is true enough.

Louis
from
his
nice best best
friend of Louis

Four horses like four notes.

Have your odyssey
How many voiced it be
"Speak to me in a different anguish

It's a bee-star - no!
a bumble-bee star - it's
a star!" A flying seeded
dandelion, a something - a jack
a star-feather - and Paul looks
as if it might sting him
as
it floats away into the grass.
To the day : a month before he was five.

I would like to
have a happy

Valentine's day because
there are no hearts. There
will be a heart because
we will send you a letter
that was from me to
divide it in half.

Take and owe nothing.
Everybody take . Here,
And owe nothing.
How else can we permit
That word , cobbler,
What else is beauty's last?

Without the mask!
Why do you flee our torches
Made out of the wood of trees
The prophets bewept and intoned?
I am different, let not a gloss embroil you.

From the spring recalled:

Unfinished is against the laws of the spirit.
Take that word I never use - no word someone
can't use.
Well-tempered forces count:
As the preludio of the Third Partita dances,
As the countersubject of the fourfold 19th fugue
Signed on death lightly ,
B,A,C,H,
Stopped here
With the last Choral-Prelude
Told his son-in-law Altnikol.
The violinist phrases - as Bach wished? From the thought of the somewhat slackened bow:
Music does not always
Call on the human voice
Only free (often wordless)
Men are grateful to one another.

Voice without scurf or gray matter,
For the eyes of the mind are proofs.

A closed missal in a flood
For posterity
To Celia
Comes from who thinks
He can say modestly
To everybody,
While you're partly right you're all wrong I speak to myself most often.
If each time a man writing a word
Thought it most completely distils him
Or did not write it All of his legend five minutes old moving thru the sixth
The strata under six - eons and eons -

[A-12]

130

He might type camions or cars
Instead of scribe as in the fourth minute
Chariots and horse.
The study of history The tree, the knee, the tea,
Societally and cyclically Sees thru a glass darkly:
Walsinghame ;
Waltzing it an era,
Dusty unseen harps,
So rich in determined loss
The loss flames and reacts,
Radiates in words ,
The inert less than an eyelet, a flower ray,
The sixth layer is Troy.

Measure, tacit is.
The dead hand shapes
An idea - seeming tiny potential
Musk - a bee robs and fertilizes.
Friends are merely bitter.
And after sixty years of
Incandescent lamps
Glass still flows like honey
Or freezes into the stone of
Striped candy children love As such True glass
That melts in the mouth
As in the rain Their frost-bit noses Durable fire .

A what-part invention -

131

[A-12]

Mildew'd ear, have you eyes?
You cannot call it love ,
The hey-day in the blood is tame?
Goodness dies - it happens In his own too much,
Holding no quantity
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind
- is blind .

What angel wakes me
From my flowery bed?
Gentle mortal, sing again .

Voice : first, body Speak, of all loves!

So is mine eye
Enthrall'd to thy shape -

You must name his name,
Half his face must be seen thru the lion's neck,
"Ladies, I would entreat you
Not to fear: my life for yours."
One must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern,
Some twelve years later with Birnam Wood .
Some man or other must present Wall.

The weaver's dobbin bobbles:
Methinks , mistress,
You should have little reason for that ;
And yet, to say the truth,
Reason and love keep little company together
Now-a-days.
The pity
... some honest neighbors will
Not make them friends.

Did Bach think sometimes like the Chinese Reason: the face of sky?
A Chinese sage speaks Chinese,
But the important thing is
What does he say? He of the Curre-Lieder.

For Centuries
As true as truest horse.

BOTTOM
Thou art as wise
as thou art beautiful.
Not so ,
But if I had wit
To get out of this wood.

You see an ass-head
Of your own, do you?
This is to make an ass of me,
To fright me if they could.

[A-12]

Do what they can.
I will walk up and down here ,
And I will walk up and down here ,
And I will sing.
Titania bespeaks these feet :

Do not desire to go;
Thou shalt remain here
Whether thou wilt or no.
I am a spirit of
No common rate,
The summer still doth tend
Upon my state,
I do love thee .

Paracelsus' Book of Bad and Good Fortune:
The sun shines upon all of us equally
With its luck. The summer comes
To all of us equally
With its luck. Our love is unequal .

"Bechardi!" "Morgen!"
"Was machst du?"

"So
How does the Czar sleep nights?"
"His regimental lights
Shout his despites
Into artillery sights:
'Shah! Shah! Shah!"

The best man learns of himself
To bring rest to others.
Verbatim:
Good Master Mustardseed, I know your
patience well. That same cowardly , giant-like
ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your
house . I promise you your kindred had made my
eyes water ere now. I desire you more acquaintance ,
good Master Mustardseed.

Child first, then ox-beef two thighs in his rump.
Eyes moistened, too.
Groin hit , breaks,
But in building
Persists as vault -

Or my father 's story
Of manoeuvres
In Most (must) when he was eleven :

[A-12]

134

He has perched over - why - valley.
In the pines
He is merry, he's free .
He sleeps, he walks
his colloquy.
His hut's on the crest
Whose drop has largess,
He sings neighbors are far,
His roofs timbers make sense.
If ridge cloud or rain
The world thunders by,
He awakes: eyes,
A face of sky.

Reject no one

135

[A-12]

and
Debase nothing.
This is all-around
Intellect.

The time would be too short Throw some part
Of your life after birds - Eat and drink.
What cry tops older
Fame - far-sighted
Not sure sense? Heart
With mind quick to love,
Look to the real thing
Unfold it within you
Turned there thru pleasure,
Bound anew.
Sweet thing, merry thing
Making your brow
Half an arch of a bridge
So that all people there
Facing round
Quicken their pace,
Fleet and lean
Desire you but to
Thirst what you have From Battle of
Discord and Harmony
Come home beloved.
Light lights
Unknown to you

"Glad they were there"
Such happy sorrow
Flying not to
Lose sight of it
Before you found them
In you again
The red-head priest's
Vivaldi's notes
A Jew's maybe
Running from mass ,
That fall anew
Our uncommon notes
Our uncommon gold,
Pale gold like halos
Setting off faces :
Who can crib
What time never heard?
"Then he put
His horse into
His pocketbook"
And you can't put
A horse into
A pocketbook
Even an old horse Despite what Lorine's tiny neighbor
Told her the night
She was a rich sitter.

You remember
The houses where we were born
The first horse pulsed
Until the evening and the morning
Were the first day?

I'll tell you.
About my poetics music
fspeech
An integral
Lower limit speech
Upper limit music
No?
To excel in humility
Is not to be humble.
Humility does not glaze
Other bodies,
With fellow creatures
Sees agony,
Is the stronger body,
With the eye of sky
Eats food that
Guano dressed .
Not a swallow made that summer.

Time qualifies the fire and spark of j
I can't improve that.
That closed and open sounds saw
Things,
See somehow everlastingly
Out of the eye of sky.
Poetics. With constancy.
My father died in the spring.

[A-12]

Half of a fence was built that summer.
For minutes as I drove nails in the lower stringer
The sunset upside down
Tops of trees, even an inverted hill,
Gauze. In the high sun
Paul spoke of garlic-salt as gargle-salt.
Spoke all the time.
C. would call the cottage Clostrophobia.
Of clapboard. Without the terra cotta
Of a della Robbia,
A family of three
On terra with grass windblown
At first tall in the new cattails.
And so little space Three tiny rooms too many It had to be shipshape.
Almost on the back cement step
Cattails - hardly firma.

My father, where shall I begin?

Who will know what you meant?

To get out of the world alive
Despite despite To live among ordinary men
And yet be alone with Him ;
To greet profanity
And from it draw the strength to live,
Said the Baalshem Thaew - as good as his name.
To sing a michtam of David,
To be alive, that is good.

139

[A-12]

All summer
Paul babbled of him
Living his life
In young memory.
Ready to speak, like grandpa Paul.
"No let's call the cottage
Grandpa Paul.
I'm sorry he died,
he asked me to come on
a week-day ,
when he could buy me a toy
I like him
better than everyone."

To begin a song :
If you cannot recall,
Forget.

Sabbath, the pious carry no money
Make no purchases. They have everything
From Friday - the Eve of the Sabbath.
Rest.
A long Sabbath.

His father, my grandfather
Maishe Afroim (the Sephardim speak differently)
Faced East in the synagogue.

On the Eve of Sabbath, at the end of Sabbath

"Sabbath has gone"
Neighbors stopped at his windows

Leaned on the sills.

A voice out of the tabernacle For the ark
Shittim wood - the acacia.

The mind that proportioned in stone
Has run from what thorny wood
Tremulous, globular flowers
Yellow , white circlets aflower
Has abstracted from the trunk trimmed
Set up for one day and moving tomorrow

The Sea ripples in Aphrodite's drapery
Her peers are the Fates - marble.
Red stain of her dawn is on them.
Enter the stone treasury
From the East, Greek,
Forget olive grove in a victory:
Your Virgin is chryselephantine,
Aegis of Zeus.
The door out is under,
The West pediment That broken triangle - standing like you Nearly night upon
Marbles of Earthshaker and Virgin
Fighting for order in Athens.

His oar not to be known from a winnow.

"Let him Aristotle" (who fled Athens)
"Examine me if he is able.

Saying '0, excuse me,

What Philo gained (?) lost to Javan,
About and rejected
So that Jesus after prayed in Gethsemane,
my Father.

In Hebrew "In the beginning"
Means literally from the head?
A source creating
The heaven and the earth
And every plant in the field
Before it was in the earth.
Sweet shapes from a head
Whose thought must live forever Be the immortelle Before it is thought
A prayer to the East
Before light - the sun later To get over even its chaos early.

[A-12]

"You should not forget Him after crossing the sea,
Pinchos"
Maishe Afroim to Pinchos Paul, after he had crossed it,
To those who could not say Pinchos.

Naming little Paul for him
Almost ninety I knew Pinchos would not mind
Their "English" names being the same .
He might have said to reprove me :
Jews remember the dead in time
Are in no hurry to flatter the living.
He never reproved me.
"Let it be Paul - I know
Ivanovich named for Ivan,
Before he is born.
Still, our Hebrew names are not the same.
Bless him , may he live
120 years."
And the end is the same :
Bach remembers his own name.
Had he asked me to say Kadish
I believe I would have said it for him.
How fathom his will
Who had taught himself to be simple.
Everything should be as simple as it can be,
Says Einstein,
But not simpler.

What can make the difficult disposition easier?
Not to be difficult.
Can there be
A difficult composition?

"I'm an artist," said Paul , my son.
"I'll do what I want
The violin in the morning,
a mister of arts,
a red fire in a blue fog at night
in the afternoon paint" (1/13 /50)

A Michtam of David,
So many times on his lips:
You have said to Him
My goodness does not extend to you,
The pious in the earth and the excellent
Are all of my delight.
These lines are pleasant to me
That I have inherited .
My heart teaches me at night.
You are before me,
You strengthen my right hand
That my breath rejoices.
You will not let me see death.
You lead me to life
Its pleasures, with your hand
Forever.

My son:
When you teach me I don't teach for hire.

To have asked such a man as your grandfather
If one may bite off
Charitable interest
From that or this loan,
Or lick off premium
from learning

[A-12]

144

And from whom
Is out of the cave
Of Shag Red or
Air-conditioned dialektike A Sum (you say)
Post-mortemer
They should have taught
You more.
Where are my dead breathing friends?
Must one spread his tongue as a doormat
for a friend to step on?

Good Friday - that's a pun.
Don't learn for revenge,
Question and question, do not be ashamed.
So that all misery may go up into the air with smoke,
As Paracelsus railed
A David in him:
As smoke is driven away, so drive them away.
Schoolmen Singers go before,
Players on instruments

Whose understanding and art are smaIl My father, who's never forsaken me
Died and I buried him.
Few are the nights I spend in one bed
As I speed to sick bodies on horse
From the poor I leave behind me :
I gave up a thin body.
All beds are racks.
They'll kill anybody they feign to treat who speaks truth.
Their understanding and art are small:
I think about that in us
That does not die,
I grow leaves.
Don't scorn me
Because I'm alone.
You run off, I am new.
My cure
Steeps in arts
That work out alike:
Alive loves,
Know and don't guess.
In this, wise,
Life's a long
Second paradise.

"My eyes are bloodshy"
(Clear, I see , clear)
Said my son
After practicing
An hour on his fiddle ;
Speaking of Lloyd
The new boy to play with:
"His name sounded
Very familiar ,

[A-12]

146

But after a while
I got used to it."
Of a dream he dreamed
Paganini playing
Mozart's Turkish Concerto.
- What did he look like, Paul ?
- A river!

Like Grandpa Paul.
The water is all of my mind,
I walk the bridge
And the only word I think of is high
Man who lives, his speech rattles in throat
and head
The sky a tine ;
How great the Soul is, Lord Dexter,
Do you not all admire and wonder to
See and behold and hear?
Can you all believe half
The truth and admire to hear Illiterate lord of a court of ships figureheads How a man drownded in the sea
What a great bubble comes up at the top of the water
This is the wind - the bubble's the soul.
All these dead years.
My mother sat away from the stoop ,
the new bridge going up ,
To catch her breath in the hottest summer.
Some old landmarks down
The bridge is aging
Effaced their ties
And their sorrow History, all its cornices.
Where is, moping?

147

[A-12]

New York's skyline's a mist of Egypt?
Where, my son, are my dead
breathing friends
Effaced in my lines, my growing sun
Who imitates my steps
Whose profile's likeness to me shocks
Who says "My God Good gracious"
As the bridge trolley darts
And breathes himself
And understands me best
Because he does not understand.

There is too much air in the air.
Too many stars too high.
A spring mattress pronouncedly spring
This is a "fall to" table, it leans
From New England, not Manhattan.
When I sit down to eat, my father drowses.
This is a "fall to" bench-trestle
It leans to the table.
My guest Henry (masculine)
What a face has the great American novelist
It says: Fie! Nancy, finance.
I have just met him on Rutgers Street, New York
Henry James, Jr.,
Opposite what stood out in my youth
As a frightening
Copy of a Norman church in red brick
Half a square block, if I recall,
Faced with a prospect of fire escapes Practically where I was born.
Breathing quite affectively in the mind
Ready to chance the sea of conversation

[A-I2]

And unshamefacedly - it has been like a warm
day The look of a shaven Chassid,
Were it possible to either him or Chassid,
Takes an impressed step forward
Pleased, not ominous in behalf of the blind or the
publicist Said the Chassid :
If you do not, Lord, yet wish to redeem
Israel, at least redeem the Gentiles.
I cannot be too grateful for what you did for Rutgers
Street
(Or for Baltimore, "That cheerful little city of the
dead")
You went down-town once
At that no beard shaking the head
- Let me go, the dawn is on us
- No, not until you bless me first
- Your name?
And the sun rose (chaos to come)
And he hal ted.
And once before, toward Haran
Lighted upon a certain place
And stayed there, the sun had set.
Stones for pillows.
He dreamed
There were angels going up and down a ladder.
Standing over him a Voice:
- I will give you the land where you sleep on stone,
Seed the dust of the earth.
Blest. And in you everybody west, east, north, south.

149

[A-12]

And awoke afraid
- How dreadful is this place
None other but His - the gate to Him.
Said: Keep me in the way I go
With bread ,
A coat to put on To come back to my father -

How else could it keep going?
Speech moved to sing
To echo the stranger
A tear in an eye
The quick hand wiped off Casually:
"I loved to hear them."

In peace
200-year spruce at least
For a fiddle for Paul :
Save
The heart of the wood so to speak
And who belongs to it.
Paul to Paul ,
Recall surely,
Carved , not the chips of the process,
Whence are the stems?
He sang sometimes, my son,
When we let him talk ,
A chance lilt ,
After prayers A shred, a repeated word , his whole world As, like Bottom,
You might blunder on tumblesalt
For somersault , Paul.
"They sang this way in deep Russia"
He'd say and carry the notes
Recalling the years
Fly. Where stemmed
The Jew among strangers?
As the hummingbird
Can fly backwards
Also forwards -

As I love :
My poetics.
"Little fish," he grieved
For his wife.
He prayed to the full moon
Over the prow
Alone on that trip
Not seasick.
He returned
For a last look
At Most
After the fire .
His boy wept
And would not let him go.
But he kissed and kissed him and crossed
The Atlantic again alone
This time to
Bring the family over.
What did he not do?
He had kept dogs
Before he rolled logs
On the Niemen.
He swam
Dogpaddle
(Dex ter, Paracelsus!)
What a blessing :

Yizchok Elchonon
Walking
On the wharf
In Kovno.
The miracle of his first job
On the lower East Side :
Six years night watchman
In a men's shop
Where by day he pressed pants
Every crease a blade
The irons weighed
At least twenty pounds
But moved both of them
Six days a week
From six in the morning
To nine , sometimes eleven at night ,
Or midnight ;
Except Fridays
When he left, enough time before sunset
Margolis begrudged.
His own business
My father told Margolis
Is to keep Sabbath.
"Sleep," he prayed
For his dead .
Sabbath.

For one day from his harness
So that a man might keep pace.

He rose rested at four.
Half the free night
Befriended the mice :
Singing Psalms
As they listened.
A day's meal
A slice of bread
And an apple,
The evenings
What matter?
His boots shone.
Gone and out of fashion
His beard you stroked, Paul ,
With the Sabbath Prince Albert.
I never saw more beautiful fingers
Used to lift bootstraps.
A beard that won over
A jeering Italian
Who wanted to pluck it With the love
His dark brown eyes
Always found in others.
Everybody loves Reb Pinchos
Because he loves everybody,
How many strangers He knew so many Said that to me
Every Sabbath
He took me I was a small boy To the birdstore-window to see
The blue-and-yellow Polly
The cardinal, the
Orchard oriole.

You must, myself,
As father of Nicomachus
Say very little
Except : such were his actions.
My life for yours.
Goodness dies The humming bird flies forward.
Buried beneath blue sky, bright sunligh t.
You'll remember:
The eleventh of April
1950.
The twelfth Snow flurries Tasting all unseasonable weather early
Alongside his "little fish"
There 23 years before him.
John Donne in his death-shroud
A saintly face in praying shawl He died happy
If you want to know
What he looked like,
Scop,
What are you asking?
He retired on old age pension $26 a month At 81 - not too late ,
He did not covet charity Or what has become of it And supported his children
Not sure now whether to

[A-12]

154

Put 91 or 95
On his tombstone.
He had forgotten birthright and birthday,
Who can remember
When every new day
May be turned into account.
What do you await?
If occasion warranted
He could tender his hand to a Polish countess
Playing the glass harmonica
And she wouldn't take offense.
His clasp pocketbook is in a lower drawer
Of his old chiffonier no one wanted.
$3 and some pennies
Saved for the synagogue He had hoped for more
But gave away
What he could not spare
To his bungling children Praising and showing their photos
They gave him.
The street never wide ~nough for him,
Taking a diagonal to cross it,
To open and close the synagogue
F or over six times ten years
Until three days before he died A longer journey than Odysseus'.
Now his namesake says:
"If it's not my kind of words
I don't want to hear them."
He died certain With such the angel of death does not wrestle And alone,
Not to let me see death :

Go home,
Celia must be anxious,
Kiss Paul."

Listen to the birds And what do the birds sing.
He never saw a movie.
A rich sitter, a broad wake.
Not a sign that he is not here ,
Yet a sign, to what side of the window
He sat by, creaks outside.
A speech tapped off music.
Draw off Still in the eye of an acacia.
Division: wits so undivided .
A source knows a tree
still not in the earth
In no hurry to shadow the living
He opens the gates of the synagogue
As time never heard
Lifting up the voice.

People carry a wood

Paul , picks the rambler Playing as you do when alone Owed the world nothing
Left it with tied
billets-doux of sons' letters.
A chest weighs at two f-holes of spruce,
On 8 ~ oz.
That support it :
A fiddle.
Then it is Stainer Jacob Stainer 16 hundreds In the Austrian Tyrol
Knocking on a tree
Sounding it to make sure
Its wood will be right.
Sitting away from the lumberjacks :
Felling Listen to them
Already shapes of violins
Tumbling down the side

At his bench thru 3 sieges
Tells someone quietly : "you wait half a year

You don't want to be the

I would like to hear you
Play Old Black Joe
And the Largo

And the red-hair's
Concerto in A minor.
Pinchos knew nothing about it Except the intention

Lost in black,

Rabbi Pinhas :
From true prayers
I took as goodness gave ,
The pupil is dark and
Receives every ray of light.
Bread and a coat:
Both are - considering
Our nature - enough with
Which to see the sky.
There, night , and sense sure ,
Else not motion or rest.
Rabbi Leib:

[A-12]

What is the worth of their
Expounding the Torah:
All a man's actions
Should make him a Torah So to light up
Whether he moves or is still.
Given a share, the body
Comports the soul.
It sees its reflection
Only when it bends to it.
It is not the same
Asking a friend ,
The world is its place.
It joins mouth and heart ,
The place and its presence
Where each creature sings its song,
It is ruled and acts
First note to fourth ,
Because of its holiness
Its song seems not holy at all ,
As in the "Section of Praise"
Uniting the degrees:
As it is, created And - ashes and ear Do you hear yourself,
You must stop.

Rabbi Pinhas: It teaches a man.
There is no one who is not
every minute
Taught by his soul.
A disciple: If that is so
Why does it not rule?
Rabbi Pinhas : The soul teaches,

I59

[A-12]

- Also. What we say
Here is heard there .

It never repeats.

A work spoken
in the name of the blest
And blest lips move in the grave
The live lips that speak it
Move with those of the blest.

It is no small thing to
hearten men
But the quiet cannot speak
Unless a tie sustain their dead That the pure body bear them up
With their light it receives
Pure oil beaten for light,
To glow - not to grovel.

When dust lights up is it even?
And when men count as they have given
Do they not slight what each is?

If it helps, diffract crystals and tracers .
Rabbi S said :
- You can learn from everything
What man has made
Has also something to teach us.

The economy of force ?

A poem whose wisdom seals the seed,
My thoughts to his,
Or facts eye of sky may read?

At a certain age the child cries about
His right to handle a gadget

161

[A-12l

Or a system for flushing one's water.
As I said one night impatiently to Paul
Who had waked me, and forgetting
I hurried , lese majeste, to flush
- Crying about flushed p?
Or as compunctious Archibald observed
Between elderly garden chores,
How people
Respond to the curtsy of a European
Kissing a lady's hand " 0 he 's a lollipop! "
To which words Paul composes a rondo
A perpetual motion.
Shall I teach Paul my nerves
Are involved in this?

An animal's scratching?
I forgot - the coffee perking.
If I remember coffee
Or Phaedo:
The lover of wisdom
Does not ask her love
To release her again
To pleasures and pains
To be undone again .
Weaving , instead of unweaving,
A fiddle Or Penelope's web .

Shall I teach him :
Who serves the public,
A heavenly singer at a feast.
Or: the noblest embraces the whole art
Involving by no means

[A-12]

The smallest traction of reason .
Or: that cannot be praiseless
Which considers each word.
Or : the lady shall say her mind freely ,
Or the blank verse shall halt for't.

With flowers of odious savours sweet.

Still owns his snowshoes
Indispensable in Macedonia.
I bought him two balloons:
"Plato" and "Aristotle".

Mounted on snowshoes.
As expected
"Plato" and "Aristotle."
"Aristotle" Carus, to Paul it was sad.

[A-12]

Dear Spring goes her way with Venus.
Before them Inevitable wonders of winds ,
After - the west wind ,
Flowers run down the lanes .
Next, heat parches
Fullgrown grain blown dusty
In annual gusts of the North.
And it is autumn.
Dancing step by step
With Euhius Euan.
Then Volturnus .
And the south wind
Whose strength is lightning.
Last , snow.
Winter renews numbing frost
Chattering teeth .
Why is it wonderful
That the moon is inevitable?

Like hell of flames
Shooting out of the tops of your heads
While your feet freeze
L. N. wrote me of our winter.

Quire of will
And fated,
Had Shakespeare read him Cribbed this?
Since in our body
Riches do not increase
Nor does lineage
Nor kingly pride,
Be sure these are nothing

[A-12]

For the mind.
For all that, the terrors of men
The cares that dog them
Are not awed by arms or by wars,
Trespassing as kings
And lords of the world,
FearJess before glitter of gold
And bright purple,
Come to ruin winning statues
And a name.
Dread of death drives them
They hate their lives and the light
Till their fretted hearts
Contrive their own deaths Unaware fear of death drove them
Cankered their honor and friends.
The body shattered by time :
Frame brittle , reason maimed,
Tongue raves , mind stumbles.
Stench final. Sleep may last then
But none thirst what he is.
Nor do diverse songs
Stop flying, wet salt savours
Into the mouth, eyes
Not a wit deceived,
There in the spots light is
And shade, nor do eyes
Know the nature of things ,
Do not accuse the eyes
Of this fault of the mind .
Can reason sprung from false senses
Speak against them?
Unless they are true
Reason is false .

[A-12]

166

Can ears judge eyes,
Or touch debate ears ,
Or mouth refute touch
Or smell disprove it
Or eyes show it false.
One sense cannot prove
Another false.
There are places out of sight
Filled with voices.
What the mind sees
And the eyes see - the
Shape of their ground, the same.
Dreaming kings storm towns
Cry aloud , murdered,
Without moving.
Love herself is away
Her ways are at hand ,
Her name sounds.
Triune of seas, land and sky
A day shall hurl to ruin ,
Burden and fabric of the world
Fall headlong.
And the golden morning light reddens
Grass and dew .
A time set in all things.
Age has its teeth fall out
(More gold in his mouth than he is worth)
And the hairless youth
Grows hairy,
A soft down flows
From either check.
Shakespeare read somehow And whom?

[A-12]

Considering researchists
Should by and large be discomfitted
As one emendator said:
- If a dog hunted fleas
on mathematical principles
He would never catch a flea
except by accident.

Shall I teach Paul ,
In Shakespeare is militarist Not recorded again until 1860?

A poetics is informed and informs Just informs maybe - the rest a risk.
Or: that a bit of culture
Dies a sudden death
Of a man over ninety
That much culture is little breath Infinite things in
Infinite modes
Follow divine nature
Being such.
Or: remember, G. S. begins
"Making of Americans"
With a quote
From Nicomachus' father With patient father and angry son That she said,
"How can you know
More than you do know
And we are still in the shadow
of explanation,"
Add to her insight ("in all periods before
Things had been said

[A-I2]

168

But never explained.
So then they began to explain " )
Long before "before"
Too , they had explained a long time.

Much Shakespeare in Aristotle,
A great deal of Shakespeare
From his young pulse
As he grew older.

Beyond Physics:
All men by nature desire
(It is put - but, in effect , love) to know
We delight in our senses
Aside from their usefulness
They are loved for themselves And most of all the sense of sight
Brings to light differences
between things.

Ethics or Character:
Seeing seems at any moment complete.
It does not lack anything Like coming into being To complete it.
Pleasure also takes this form At no time more complete
If it lasts longer.
For this reason it is not a movement.
Said Nicomachus' father, in character,
A character sometimes caught up by words
In his teacher's Republic:
Eyes, their excellence, that is, sight -

[A-J2]

Justice like sight, hearing, health
Or any other real, natural,
Not merely conventional good.
Elsewhere, beyond physics,
He reproved his teacher :
How can we know the objects of sense
Without having the sense,
His Forms destroy the things
For which we are more ardent
Than for Being of the Ideas,
Whatever that is; To us, forms effect the arts
For whose sake mind and nature move ,
If forms do not move
Where is motion Plato wiped out the study of nature.
Rather he wrote on double palimpsest On some pages nature is erased
And on others enlivened,
As it were restored.
It wouldn't do at any time
For some Northwest Coast Indian
To re-collect Be as an archetype of bees
And neglect his to not-be A verb which he has No more than it would have done for an
ancient Hindu.

If love exists, why remember it?

So to light up
Whether one moves or is still.
Number slain.
Hearts remote, yet not asunder

Distance, and no space was seen
Reason, in itself confounded,
Simple were so well compounded Is is any wonder
A commentator
Doubts Shakespeare worked these lines?
Their source?
Character, father of Nicomachus Simple the certain nature -

Those who sing Psalms,
Odes of bright principle
Come from the sky,
Uniting the degrees.

Appealed Inthehighest.
We speak of heavenly songs. They
Are intoned neither by harps nor lutes,
Are a noise in the clouds
An echo from earth;
In the stars the skills are arts
All crafts are hidden
All widsom, all reason
Also all foolishness,
Without Venus, no music would ever be
Without Mars, no crafts
(Planet - not war)
Man was not born of a nothing
But from a substance
Limus terrae - extract of stars
And all elements.
Therefore the Great World
Is closed
So nothing can leave it.

[A-12l

Close to it there is the Little World ,
That is to say, man,
Enclosed in his skin
That bounds his body,
And with it he sees
Two Worlds that must not mingle
(As the Sun shines - but itself
Does not pass thru glass _
Divested of all but light So the stars light one another inside him)
Earth - seen and touched
Heavens - unseen and untouched:
Together life.
As herder sees each people,
A living mirror of the stars,
Each with its lot - a guide
Never to be copied exactly,
Teaching never to repeat:
The body attracts a heaven
That imprints nothing on us
Endowed as we are with complexions,
Qualities, habits, endowed
As we are with life.
The child's mother is its star and planet
Man is the Little World, but woman the Littlest.
And Great, Little, Littlest has each
Its own way but all three are borne.
One single number should determine our life: 1.
Greater has no peace or rest,
A calculator counts further
Who can say at what number be stops?
This question gnaws Paracelsus.

Better a fiddle than geiger?

And in one:

Who can adjudge stages
Or write wisely
Where cycles started or ended,
Without stories to drag them Men's actions encompass whaletooth to scrimshaw?
The town Mystic has as it were a toy drawbridge
on Main Street, wharves, ships;
Its marine museum speaks red and black India ink
where sail needle pricked ivory, speaks
Of file, pocket-knife , wood-ashes, sailors' idle palms
scrimshanting
In 1820ies. "All these 24 hours
Small breezes, thick foggy weather."
The brig By Chance made no sale.
"So ends this day, all hands employed scrimshanting."

You cannot take out of the circle - what was in it,

[A-12]

[A-12l

that is and will be A father "patient" and "angry" by turns
as his son sees it
Either another event
Pinprick of contents , but an assemblage
of all possible positions The locus, sometimes As Baruch said accursed, nevermind blest Since men would rather imagine than understand
And chance is imperfect knowledge
And body exists as we feel it
And essence is that remove, that degree,
without which a thing is no thing
(Defined is defined)
And nothing happens in the body
That is not perceived by the mind
The mind also conceives by its power A contents that is as in the song "sweet content."
Since no one cares about anything he does not love
And love is pleasure that dwells on its cause
He who loves keeps what he loves:
An image inwreathed with many things
That may flourish, that draws cause
To light up.
If the understanding perceives the idea of
quantity as cause
It determines the quantity
So to speak from motion
(A line from motion of a point,
A body from motion of a plane)
Yet these are not understood
Unless quantity is perceived
And the motion be made to endure
Forever,

"The horse bends down" - Paul, '46, May.
A center as it were
From which his hoofs
Spark clusters of stars
That weaving bobble
No one spark the same like another But there are families of them
It becomes involved,
Sometimes arbitrary.
The horse sees he is repeating
All known cultures
And suspects repeating
Others unknown to him,
Maybe he had better not
Think of himself
Hunting so to speak
Sowing so to speak
Composing always .
The shape of his ground seems to have been
A constant for all dead horses
His neigh cultural constant
Also his sniff It is some such constant when a culture
Seems to revert a hundred years
Or some thousands?
And instances from "different" cultures, suprisingly
inwrcathed,
Seem to look back at one another,
Aristotle at Shakespeare (both so fond of blind heroes)
And blest Spinoza at Shakespeare -

174

175

Which could not be
Without a thought
Of infinite quantity .

[A-12l

[A-I2]

How?
Or for that matter uninwreathed
As Rig-Veda at me,
Because none has to read the
other yet it happens.
As Bach calls to composers and writers of my time.
If Paul loves Bach I need not tell him
Johann Seb Bach, as he calls him,
Is present
His legs in a gigue
Old French, to dance (giguer) or hop
From gigue (Teuton geige - a fiddle)
Half his seat out of his seat at the organ,
Like his contemporary hopping Chassid
Who might have shook
To the Prelude of the Third Partita.
In someone else it's Theocritus
Supposed to come thru
Does he know it.
One's a lucky horse
For Bach's jigging fire to come thru
And be new.
Take that of Lear, my friend, who has the power
To seal the accuser's lips in behalf of
Some with insight, some with a great deal:
Bottom W., Polonius T.,
Hamlet H. (for Hamlet) Adams Or what composer is it modal from M. Croche
not a bit (not a bit modish?) too soon Believe I am Seti First
presenting Lotus to Osiris : it
Hurries to Socrates
Whose words are real
Otherwise why must two words balance opposites -

To Socrates nature does not walk on one leg only.
Has then nature legs Countless? A poet dares beg the question ;
Hemlock Socrates purging a scruple
Bothered before death - he had never before
bothered to try the sound of words,
Turning, after loving wisdom, Aesop to rhyme .
Just as the eye that sticks with rime cannot move
When faced to the wall of a cavern from
Darkness to light
without turning the whole body
So the instrument of knowledge
Plays only when the beloved's head
Turns from Passing to Being
So learns by degrees Who knows what Plato thought anyway
With so much sight honeybee, to sound
How perilously. "The eyes of the mind are proofs,"
Spinoza, did not mean to be Plato, how could he?
What is this Sight of Being?
Plato: "its brightest and best - good."
Baruch not dupe to think it was made for man:
"A man can neither be nor be conceived
without the power of enjoying the greatest good."

176

177

Sane, vain and mad enough
To call himself Paracelsus:
In each (of Three Worlds) an urge to exceed
And none wants to act with measure,
To the end that balance be
And no crooked thing,
That nothing exceed the circle.
Rests before the mirror

[A-I2]

Where its image rests. The image
Is not sole object of knowledge. Nor is man
Whose knowledge comes from outside him The mirrored image he is.
Together men form one sky.
The sky is a man,
You must know this to understand
Why places are different
And things new and old
Why everywhere things are different,
You cannot find out
By looking at skies alone
But from their effects.
One sky is rich in each of us,
Undivided.
When a child is conceived
It gets a sky for a gift.
Fire warms thru the walls of a stove
A man's body acts from afar and rests,
Qualified by the forces that flow from it
Its thought is abroad,
Neither that of element nor star,
Free for new craft to flow into it,
All arts are not in one's country
But everywhere in the world
There to be gathered and sought.
The physician learns from old women,
Gypsies, peasants, vagabonds
People at random.
Art pursues no one, is rather pursued,
But everyone wants to fly before he has wings.
(Some hundred years later the blest:
A timid child thinks he can fight.)
Medicinal roots are in the just heart

[A-12l

178

Each part is judged from the work
This art puts wisdom to work
By wisdom art makes it,
Despite there is poison in all things
The dose makes it poison or not.
The physician's schools are three Elements, stars, the Light
All burn in him.
And tho he is earth -

The horse - between his hoofs
And ground sparks rise
The four hoofs of each horse
Are different, different from his fellow's horse
And the ground is worn Wears the light of nature (Nothing but reason - love - )
There it is, yet what is gone is gone
And it is the new Time.
The horse plods and learns
Neither sleep nor Sabbath can rest him
If he is called on to write a book
And it is put by for a life
Nothing fails it
Cared for in his mind,
He need not rush at the book.
It is never late
What must be born.
At last he finds
What he has never
Learned or seen:
Man a shape like
The satyrion root,

179

[A-12l

Chicory high
When the sun is in the sky
Its root a bird
After seven years.
If you know the answer
Keep still,
If you don't, try
Find out.
The carpenter's beam runs thru his head
His virtue forms his shape.
Who draws maps pores over
Hands of landscapes, countries, streams.
Old son and - or - new,
Whiling away
Is not whole.
To plod is not hobble .
Each time has Love's way with music.
You keep up to date
On all fours
That canter sometimes
Before boughs that grace trees.
Sparks from hoofs :
There is horse;
Like-sparks
His old love or new reason
Expect.

So year to year Nor do the arts
Ever end.
How can man say
"I am certain"
For certain and uncertain

[A-12l

Do not make certain.
Only forever is previous
And not a horse's forever.
If someone stole off with its body
Be sure that its spirits
Canter forever.
Blacksmith, creator, shapes his shoe

Wisdom's enemy is no one
But unwise,

Against - against nature.
light is not unhappy.
Night: not unhappy.
Who walks in both, or in either, walks well.

Uncountable stars

Read what it says, asked Paul.
I was trying to abstract
A story
From the Levitical sacrifices.
For all inwreathed in me
That make my love
Your fiddle,
To some imagined music,
When it shall be your own
In the world, thru some sense of the bow
alone
Shall tell the strings
Their Great World quietly In the time I owe the world nothing What in you
Of my father who owed a Source
Or his little fish
Of when I walked with him,

[A-12]

With you or with Celia, a night
Or with the winds
Say what their wonders with cities are
With seas in arms of landscape, a thought or a hand
Slowing that I do not see death
When an air seems too much in the air:
My time will run me
I am not all of my time
No one is all of it.
M. Croche wondered about Alessandro Scarlatti's
Writing at least 106 operas:
Good heavens how gifted the man must have been
And how could he find time to live,
There's a Passion according to St. John by him
Whose choruses seemed to be written in pale gold
Like halos, primitive frescoes (M. Croche Antidilettante,
Asked nearly the year
I was born near the Third Ave. "L"
Where we lived looking into a dance-hall) I cannot
imagine
How he found time to have a son
And make a harpsichordist of him Domenico.
My time runs me
With primitives'
Divine arabesque:
Ornament not in
Musical grammar.
Palestrina, Vittoria, Orlando di Lasso
Strengthened its delicate traceries The bass of their form By strong counterpoint.
When Bach renewed arabesque
He made it more pliant, more fluid.

[A-12]

What stirs is
his tracing a particular line,
Tracings of lines
Meeting by chance or design.
With him ornament,
acquires
A precision of appeal Let no one think it
Unnatural.
As Spinoza said in this line If they understood things
My arguments would convince them,
Simple mathematics,
Altho they might not attract them :
There cannot be too much merriment,
It is always good.
To make use of things, to take
Delight as much as possible
(Satiety forsakes them)
Is the part of a wise man,
To feed himself
Good food and drink,
To take pleasure
With growing plants, dress, music,
Cities which men may use without hurt
to their fellows:
The human body has parts
of different nature
That continuously want new
and varied nourishment
So it may be apt to do
As can follow from its nature
And the mind at the same time
Understand many things.

[A-12]

This manner of living
Agrees best with our principles,
Wherefore, if there be any other,
This manner is best,
In all ways to be commended,
Nor is there need
To be clearer:
The human body needs many bodies
To be, so to speak, regenerated ,
The human mind can move other bodies
in many ways
And dispose them in many ways,
It is apt to perceive many things
And more so according as its body
Can be disposed in more ways.
A sound akin to mosaic :
A rhythm of eyes
Almost along a line
Looking into and out of the frame Empress Theodora and court ladies
Moved to the East
Where the sun begins.
Unearthed catacombs
Brought into the sun
Whereto is playing
A good shepherd's song
Amidst plenty of sheep.
Saul struck: "Whose son?"
"David, the son of' his psalm.
Intervals only of seconds,
But not harping allover the stave,
Fingers imperceptibly moving near
Strings ready to sound

From open to stop in a twinkling,

Disposed in many ways
No less surprising and quiet
Than that, 1313, Rabbi Hacen Ben Salomo (Great One Singer Son of Peace) Taught Spanish Christians
To dance in a church.
No less surprising and quiet To Ambrosio and Guglielmo, Jews
Said to dance "above all human measure"
a special license
from the Pope (1575).
Guglielmo's pupil as good as he
Jewish minstrels and troubadours
By that Sea literally in the Middle of Land,
Dances and cities which men may use
Without hurt to their fellows
With justice flamed with freedom
What more happy song than one's lot?
Love does not wish you to be anything else.

As eyes one does not work to dim
But rests so they work a whole life - the future
No lighter for greed of it Their need seeks no death
In extra chores that close them with pennies,
People are pigs,
Precisely, pigs are not people.

A poet is not at all surprised by science.
That you may play better
Paul, who saw "Beauty and the Beast"

[A-12l

186

And asked how soon will the beast become lovely ,
For all inwreathed
This imagined music
Traces the particular line
Of lines meeting
by chance or design

Well, now then,
With the winds
Says what their wonders with cities are ,
With seas in arms of landscape ,
This music
Moved by a thought to a hand -

In my city one wished me death,
Nevermind,
The stars last more than one night The hidden so disposes imagination,
And so the body to take on a nature
Opposed it seems to itself, of which no idea
Can be given the mind, but that a man
Out of need of his nature should try not to exist
Or appear changed
Is as impossible
As for any thing to be made out of nothing,
This everyone with a little re.flection
May see :
Anyone can kill himself, compelled by some other
Who twists his right hand
Which holds perhaps a sword
So it is led against his own heart,
Or like Seneca by the command of a tyrant,
Be forced to open his veins ,
To avoid more evil by taking on less -

[A-12l

'

Many things sleepwalkers do
They would not dare if awake -

All of which shows
That the body can do many things
By the laws of its nature
At which the mind is amazed;
No one knows how
The mind moves the body
(Cerebral charges? were discovered
Some time ago thru poetry
Not surprised in the least
By new science)
Or by what means,
Nor how many degrees of motion
It can give the body ,
Nor with what speed it can move it.
Whence if men say this or that action
Arises from the mind
That has power over the body
They confess specious words
That do not regard it with wonder ;
When the body sleeps
The mind's unconscious (Spinoza very early on
that)
Has not the power
It has when awake.
The mind is not always apt
For thinking its subject,
Only as the body is apt
For the image of this or that
To excite it
Does the mind see the object.

I looked

[A-I2]

188

When we dream that we speak
We think we speak
From free decision of the mind;
Yet we do not speak, or if we do,
This decision thought to be free
Is imagination - or memory;
Is nothing but the accord
An idea involves.
A suspension of judgment
Apprehends, is not free.
In dreams also we dream that we dream,
I grant no one is deceived
In so far as he perceives.
The imaginations of the mind
in themselves
Involve no error,
But I deny that a man
affirms nothing
In so far as he perceives -

SPINOZA.

Facing south, I looked
At the ferry at South Ferry
At night, the ruins of Castle Garden
Where Jenny Lind sang
Before my time - with the diamonds
Of the songs of the nightingale Long after the Castle became the Aquarium :
Swung back by my young pulse,
Recalled a seal in teal blue,
A compass in binnacle Asleep or sleepless
Held on to Paul's hand.

[A-I2]

The full moon rose. Flowed in the water.
The harbor
Had the sea's face: C's face as expected.
And unknowing, Haran
Lighted south, west, north, east
The red ferry pulling out of its slip
Its bell ringing
By intermittences
Our bloods submitted,
Like crazed Randolph
Ringing a bell sometimes in Congress
Was it? and muttering "it's all over,"
The New Jersey farmer's
Improved wagon-wheel
T.J. uncovered in Homer
And the first John Jacob Astor's
Landing in Baltimore
With $25, and seven flutes to sell So much change.
And it occurred to me
How cities rise and fall,
As once in Cambridge,
During the last war
When Scollay Square tap danced so lively
It rose as it were Queen Elizabeth's heir
In Boston: there on SECRET business
(Everybody's the next day
Tho this anybody worded no breath to How a war gets around!)
But the eyes more congenial
To the Xmas candy building
of Massachusetts Hall Some time to think over a day away from home Before going back to the hotel -

[A-12J

Looked - before '76
When Boston breathed cannon Old North Church is lost at the foot of the hill
Boston is an old copper sink
its freighted harbor viewed from Mather's grave Its story: North Station to Back Bay to Commonwealth
The same in New York,
Lower East Side to Village to Riverside Drive.
Slums where the first had settled by water,
Rich founders moved inalnd
Leaving a silt of poor,
Insolvent wealth spooned into an art colony
With some Ciceronian virtu earning
The rich estates furthest up the river The silt burnished to catch up,
As the city rose and fell, everything "too much"
As Fred Allen chid "for the Moses model human body"
The greatest networks, THE most executive
Carbon monoxide, noise and bubble gum yet,
All eyes, not one, Fred Rockbottom,
Equal to one flyspeck,
From soap to razors
Everything extraordinary
Washed clean and black as a nobleman's
posterior Go and praise London , waltzed Chopin
Whom his lady friend was used to seeing in heaven,
In this angel's case
Being alive or dead
Did not matter The attraction that led instinct to pursue
so many and
Such varied lines to such great distances
Intensely strong and indefinitely lasting

Fearing: old men and old women

Of boys and girls playing,
A painter's thoughts
Of children singing without notes
As they eyed each other,
His wager on a genius

The works that become all hours
The hour they no longer hear
Save the excellent In Delacroix' sight
Sketching horses,
Of his trade longest to learn
That asks the learning of the composer,
The occasions of the violinist Works that practiced
Strengthen twisted fingers
And that the unpracticed should not attempt
Before seeing a surgeon,
The bodies for whom without Bach
The fingers are not free.
To memorize, that love make the tone .

So that timbre understands timbre
And each moves to all

Extends, said his brother,
Laying a plane under all formulas
And enmities, where men
Meet, not paid to talk.

Unable to stop.
False words helped the affliction.
But worse

Hanging from spectacles
In front of dead eyes,
Not fear to look
Like death warmed over,
To wolf crumbs
From a flying roll
Eat raw cabbages

After being lashed in common.

To help forward the affliction.

Attracted him ;

Did not stop him A mixed breed I couldn't shoo him off.

I walked faster
Trying to keep a distance
Between us,
So the motorists
Wouldn't blame me for him.
I wouldn't touch him
When he caught up .
So he'd run ahead
And look back to make sure
I was following,
And wag his tail.
I couldn't hide from him
So I thought I'd better
Get off the highways ,
And when I slowed up to cross
He was hit. But not hurt.
We stalled the traffic
Northbound and southbound.

Resist

Dear Mr. Zukofsky,
Well the way it look know , is that I won't be
home for a long time. We finist our basics training
last week and now started our unite training. It is
suppose to last 13 weeks. After that we will be ready
for combat.
I don't know just what is up. Some of the guys
say that we will be going to Germany and some say
to Korea. But there's a job to be done. I just hope
I can do my part. The way I feel is that I would
rather be back home again. But I guess that's the
way everybody think. I just hope by the time Paul
grow up he won't be in it. Tommy has to register
the end of this month. I guess they well let him
finesh high school.
Well I guess that is all for now. Hope everything
is OK. back in New York. Tell Paul I was asking for
him.

were going to leave , but we are still here. They did take
out 20 guy. From what I understand they are going to
Karia. I guess I was lucky. But it's just a matter of time I
guess before we all will be leaving.
I have K.P. tommrow and I an trying to get all
my letter writing done today. So please excuse my writing.
I am taking a couple USAF I courses in Plumbing. I
don't know if it will help me, but I will now a little more.
There are quite a few guy taking these courses. If I make
out with the first course I am going to try to see if I can
get a high school deploma. Thank you for the cookies you
sent me. I got them the other day they were very good. It
make me feel good knowing that somebody else is thing of
me. I got a letter from Peter and he said that it was
snowing back home. I guess it's pretty cold back home too.
The weather is pretty good now. The temperature go up to
about 80 during the day, but it get pretty cold at night.
And right now I have a little cold.
Tell Paul, that I am all right and if God is willan I
will see him someday. Tell him, that we salute the flag the
same way we salute the officers except when we are under
armes then there are different ways of saluting.

April 27, 1951
Hello Zukofsky
I don't know just what to say. So many thing
have happen in the last month, that I can't keep up
with then. But I will start when we left camp. It
was Friday, March 31, at 9 o'clock at night that we
left. We aboarded a train at the camp, that took us
to San Francisco. We arrived there around 8 o'clock
Saturday morning. At 10 o'clock we aboarded the
Breckinridge. The ship that took us to Japan. There
was 2,700 GI. on it. After being on it for a week
we cross the I 80th. Merdian, commonly known as the
International Dateline. Of course we were all initiated
into the Royal Order of the Dragon-backs. You can
guess what happen. Most of the guy lost all or most
of there hair. I happen to be one of the first to go
through and didn't lose much. I didn't get sea sick as
I though I would. The first day out I felt kind of
funny, but after that I was alright. I think if I ever
have to go into the service again, I will go into the
Navy. The boys on our ship had it pretty easy.

[A-12]

218

Friday, April
13, we derk at the port of
Yokohama 5,263 miles from San Francisco. We derk
about I o'clock in the afternoon and stay on the
ship until midnight. (What for I don't now) After
getting off the ship we had to wait for two hour
untill our train came. It took us another two hours
to get to the camp, wish is only 25 miles from
Yokohama. So you can see how the railroad are in
Japan . The only mean of transportation are bicycle,
trains, and your feet, which they used quite abit. The
shack are nothing but paper. I wouldn't want to live
here all my life. The only thing I can say is "Thank
God Ian an America" You don't realize how well off
you are until you see how they live here.
The cost of living is very high around here, a
haircut cost you 25¢. At the snack bar you can get
a hamburger for 1O¢. It's just like being home before
the
war.
For
entertainment
on
Sunday
we
go
sightseeing and shopping tours, Monday they put on a
show ,
Tuesday
they
have
Japanese
entertainment,
Wednesday is bingo, Thursday they have a dance,
Friday we have more Japanese entertainment, Saturday
they have another dance, or you can play pool or
ping pong. For other entertainment there is a bowling
allay, theater, swimming pool, tennis court, baseball
diamond, and the one everybody will attend when they
get pay, the beer hall.
We are suppose to get paid this coming Monday.
It just so happen that it's the first of May, and we
are
on
the
alert.
From what I understand the
Communists had a big time here last year, so they
put us on the alert this year. All the guy are hoping
that they do do something, so they can get a little
exercise. You see this camp is only one mile square ,

21 9

[A-12]

and it only hole a battalion, which lam in. There is
no place to train, so since we got here, we haven't
done a thing. From what I understand we will be
leaving this camp the 8 or 9 of next month. We are
suppose to go somewhere up in the mountain to finish
our training. We are all hoping that when we finish
our training that we come back here. Then we would
have it made. But then again the Army doesn't work
that way. The day we left the camp the mail man
came up to me and ask me if I wanted the job. So
what could I say, but yes. The job isn't to bad. One
reason I took it was that I didn't have to pull KP.
or Guard Duty.
Well Mr Zukofsky,
don't know of anything
more I can say. It look like I ran out of word. Tell
Paul I was asking for him and hope he is alright. I
hope you folks are to.

Camp McNair, Japan
June 14, 1951
Dear Zukofsky,
Ian very sorry I didn't write before this. But Ian
so far behind in writing to everyone, that it isn't
funny. Please for give me.
Well there isn't to much to say. We stay at
Camp Fuchinobe for a month and then we went by
truck to Camp McNair. When we were at Fuchinobe
why, I went to Yokohama. It was quite a ride You
have to change trains about six times. It was very
interesting. You should see the thing they have for

[A-12]

220

sale. I think everyone in this country know how to
paint. There are three or four guy around here every
week painting pictures. And they do a good job.
On the way to Camp McNair the land look
beautiful. The first big hill we went over we could
see Mount Fuji and didn't it look beautiful. It took
us five hour to get to the camp. When we got there,
there was a sign at the gate which said in Japanses.
(This is hell) You can believe that. You couldn't walk
anywhere with out getting all mad. It isn't to bad
now, I guess we got here after it had rain for a
couple of day. The Camp is right at the base of
Mount Fuji. I think the mountain has something to do
with the weather.
Well I guess it won't be long before you will be
going to
-. I hope you have a nice summer there.
Tell Paul
was asking about him. Well I guess this is
it for now. Hope everything is alright. I haven't gone
to Tokyo yet. But if there is anything else you want
let me know. Be good.

Dear Zukofsky,
I sorry I didn't write before this but
with moving and then the first of the month comning
up so soon I didn 't have much time.
I want to thank you for the candy you sent me.
I got it just when I needed it. The food lately hasn't
been to good but I guess that the way the Army feed.
Right now we are on a ship heading down the
coast of Japan. We are to make a landing tomorrow
morning. The way it look now the war will be over
pretty soon. I hope so!
Tell me how is Paul doing this summer. I suppose
he is alway playing with Peter. If you should see Peter
one of these day ask him how the Red Sox are doing.

Nicomachus, the physician, had a son
Aristotle who had a son Nicomachus Aristotle's sun? Without him no Mean
Golden or safe wrapped or rapped in the loquacious?
He'd heard Wisdom say foolish things and caught
Its sense, grew plants, fled lest Athens swim twice
Against philosophy from vague feeling
To a bad heart, from wish-bone to no sense Lectured walking. Spoke for himself to his son?
We pardon more easily natural desires Anger rather than bad taste. Take for instance ,
The man who defended striking his father Saying, My father also struck his father,
Grandfather his father - and pointed to
His child - And he'll strike me as soon as he
Grows up, it runs in the family. Or
The man who dragged on the floor by his son
Asked him to stop at the door for he himself
Had dragged his father that far and no more.
When love laughs that carefully it has eyes
And Authority has a nose of wax.

The lover of myth loves wisdom : both wonder.
Tents pick up , hoplites charge, Horae dispose.
The wise man lacking detail knows at that
And while we must begin with what is known
Things are known in two ways, some to us, some
We say, are known without qualification:
So a certain nature is simple and
Loved, all other things moved to it are moved,
So art that has cannot have more or less,
As a house loves the ground, is like the man
Who owns it , it is itself and is his,
Has a floor and warms, no cellar to flood,
No attic to stifle the air it breathes,
It does not leave off making space,
Its building is an agreeable habit.
Making friends from self-probing, quite lonely
Until we know love is loyal to one person,
Happiness is not present at the start
Like a piece of property and is only
Accidentally concerned with the good
Of the artist - failing he must blame himself He wants impossible liveforever
While justice is to persons as well as to things.
Nothing is better for being eternal
Or more white than white that dies of a day.
To be is better than not to be. To
Live -

I have often wondered
why (Beethoven) called himself
brain-owner, when the
possession of a brain
spells a danger to
the naivete of an artist
for many pseudo-historians?"

It is honest history to admit this possession

Except to the conceit
of the dull corpus.
Honest to remember that Bartok of another mind,
Like Schonberg, did not acquiesce quietly

- Not me; blind research
Only an excuse for laziness
Or the harmony of chances.

By Charles Jennens the

Virtuoso, Handel's friend,
Another of the 1619 edition
Presented to the U. of Virginia
By Col. Thomas Mann Randolph
Son-in-law of Thomas Jefferson.
We sit down, two benches removed from the man with the paper,
If under the new promenade's flourescents
Just lit to hum a night
I pulse to notes a ten year dance
And let your dissonance counter them
How mean of me ridden by words
Always to think at first of being disturbed
by the dissonance
When the years make their order.
Order rains- Lucretius did not quite say that.
Torrential rain from interminable height
A planed splay
Thins, files
As does lightning before one can say it, lighting
A rain's slant on fog
Thru later thunderclaps
Horse torso off
Mural says to Tempera and
Mrs. Oil responds
- Tuppence, Brumous
For your thoughts
- You said siphonate
For hyphenate.
Alliterate often equals anyone can stutter.
And yet we are outwardly quiet.
-Obviously characters
He ambles
She ambles with glasses
That other with a feather.
The old dowager again
Crossing her ankles as she walks
Reliving the ballet
Ice cream (out of Godey's)
Melting.
Good only when a grace is added

Radiations of quickest economies
Somehow last long.
- That kid, banderlog singing.
'I think, madam, you can hardly
Be aware that your child's song
Is a cause of annoyance to the rest of us'
(The writer not what he says but whispers, like
Brother Harry) 'Let me impress upon you ..
One word you must inscribe upon your banner
.. Loneliness.'
- Ha-ha the monkey of it.
No one should upbraid corpses
The French take their hats off to them.
We venerate our young
Instead of feeling as the Chinese of the last century
Proud of accumulating years ..
Our bones ripen it is true
F or their ultimate repose .. but
How small a price to pay ..
For those adequate conceptions in whose possession
According to Spinoza's wisdom true felicity consists.
- The afterglow in the two tallest Manhattan skyscrapers
Has stopped glaring in my face
They are cut of white cardboard
On the blue
These blossoms nourished by something
As ugly as manure .. and the questionable gold
The world keeps putting .. into (my?) pocketsHis Quaker mother teaching them:
'Girls don't be too unselfish.'
As if their little lines and wrenched effects
Fluttered with the Savoyards out of the century's beginnings
For all of a world travelling in planes,
'Dear Mr. Gilbert, what is Mr. Bach composing now?'
'0 dear madam, Mr. Bach is decomposing.'
The Gainsborough boy always ready to gain,
The Blue Boy uncommissioned,
Overheard "Sharp" Cathedral for Chartres.
- Front is dress shirt
Under is dirt.

Nostril singing
Milch and her co-warts.
Public walks projeks' rejeks
Deject subjeks no objek.
If with light head ..
From my poor love of anything .. But if
Listening behind me for my wit ..
The pricked horse's (inner?) ear.
The joys of my Old World have gone
From this new world - Oo~ah - maybe the little Porto Rican boy
Still has them, waving the Flag with its
Fiftieth star for Hawaii.
Everyone now eats lamb with rose peas.
A dream of diet
Mostly the tie pin in the Iceberg (lettuce)
Recalls The Stronger, I didn't have the strength
To become your enemy
So I became your friend.
But I didn't have the strength to
Become your friend, so I became your enemy
Is just as true.
Roiled despite oysters
Shades of publicity
They dream their money to eat out fashionably
Orientals in tails crescents on their heads
Pastegem tiaras triumph with pomp thru the provinces.
The Chief of State for latrines or the Nations run by
a Doctrine
Feels a little younger at 85 And his best matched opponent
Who interpreted classically
Will never stand for the Herald in Agamemnon
Kissing his native soil as the enemy's arsenal Are alike being their own flues for natural gas,
Power never yet harnessed.
The second of uncertainty before the crescent's fluorescence
(Here history could not resist my sleep)
Fifty analysts puttered one hundred drinks round its
symposium couch
Beat stellar bottoms Emerson's noMe chemistry

Poured out
Sunshine from cucumbers come true.
Or is the shine of any kid's pants seat
Reared from the floor
On a rainy day
A sign the solar universe
Is not running down,
Charlie befriending the kid
'There can't always be the orange outweighing the pea.'
An orange our sun-the pea, wee wee
'So I'm not afraid of all this atom business.'
For Saadi sat in the sun
Thanks .. his contrition ..
Saadi loved the brood of men . . said
It was rumored I was penitent
But what have I to do with repentance.
Not the unwashed lather startles,
The white of the unshaven beard
But that's as it is
When 'within a month' we overhear
'In-laws are outlaws.'
- ShaIl we go home?
- There's a sailboat, a sloop.
- StiIl reading it
I wonder how far he's got
In that newspaper.
To his last best days on earth
The submarine that wouldn't stay down
The midge wing cycle of 1000 flaps per second
The Worm and Bug Committee's faith in the American farmer
Eastern Hemisphere versus American Beauties?
A distraction diffraction deal on the old firehouse.
- Do we get up?
- We have walked today
My lean old shanks hurt.
Twenty years since I've walked
From 12 Street home all the way
Across Brooklyn Bridge.
- But it was worth seeing
The Old Fire House Museum on Duane Street.
[A-I3]

280

A chaise whose two wheels carried the roIled rubber
Hose as if it were a lady
The Baltimore steam engine that sprayed
Water for 39 hours from its
Nickel and silver towers, only fifty years and
Museum pieces with the old gas mantle street lamp
Brought there maybe from C Street
Become fiIl-in for an avenue Unlit and under where they once lived We saw the rat lofts on Greene Street
The red iron-doored windows which never openedFathers brothers and sisters
Walked towards them two miles six days a week
As operators pressers and finishers.
Overlook these parts of the score
The French conductor out of his ulcers
Advised his orchestra, for look over.
Aging as who does not alone
I remember another language
'I can't rear myself to shwenk de wesh'
(Rinse the wash)
Cloth of a greeting as friends met going to work
'A broch zu dir Semmele hust shayn a colt'
(The a's Latin tho, the tone's sneeze Prospero's)
'Luck rack you Sammy you have a cold'
Cannot render it.
What father dreamed then of a grandson
Translating Latin sentences'The sword wiIl be hidden in the man,
And the javelin in the bad boy.'
Or of Admiral Kickover
Red shoes and red do's,
Massive bleeding of a Prophet with government property
On his pyjama seat lacerating
Theological tarts and trembling hortatory
Out of pseudepigrapha, Fathers and canon
Contra bore with his dichotomy
Dick and a cot and 0 me
Isorhythm- I-so rhythm,
Dominations and angelic orders and kings

Coke and Coca Cola,
Against against a clay ton of editor
Who started as a shipping clerk
In a publisher's office and
Worked his way down to the top.
Corporations' incorporations
Ass up mentals: hay, bee, sea.
And proselytes ran off to give birth to Jesus.
Security? a leg's not safe
Even in bed it's seized with a crimp.
Satori oop my urethra noises
But not the muzjik's noises.
Or who dreamed then I would sit here
Envisioning a cellist
A tossed-off architectural fa<;ade
Every stroke of the bow
A frozen horizontal bar
His cello shined up like an old shoe
To look new, tied comfortably
For the used foot to move, or my word
A placed old shoe for a new foot.
Immortal, the hymn, the old man taller
Tapped his head a little preoccupied.
Belles-lettres-let her rather
See you come out simply
The less of all that the better
Memory can be a nothing towards something
A something towards nothing.
- You have been dozing
And he must have the eyes of a cat.
Nothing ran to a fire as fast as a thoroughbred
The Triangle fire how many corpses
Hasn't burnt them- fire traps, rat lofts
Iron-doored, boarded - at last- coming down.
In the infants and ladies whitegoods, shoddy remnant

The risen arcades of Richardson's spacious windows
Persist stacking reflected formations of clouds over

Into the past Irving's low town house with flower boxes, Twain
Smoking nearby about the time Henry James returned to take it
in again
In a state of desire .. so as to .. care better .. just facts
Linen against an elegance when the Mews were still real stables
Behind the American Classical of Washington Square.
The extremes meet now in the televised education of the University
That has extended the Square to a Union where the flocks of
Grandsons and granddaughters who take courses eat- and learn
From the newspaper how Downtown Business is saving little
Old New York, where today of its past I reappeared
A permanent fixture some sibylline hindsight praising
the grille work
Of Worth Street whitewashed to look as it was a hundred years ago.
And if the job is only half done, and business may never
complete itO Pompeian florals An old sound track it was made W. C. Fields ventriloquially
blare like the Sibyl: Pay
No attention to those dastardly fee-splitters.
Languidly precise Chopin playing to Mickey Mouse
In a world (of the survival of the misfittest?) where
You have to eat three times a day says our Cyrus two billion in holdings I can very well hear him doing it.
- Nod off
You had better sleep home
But today Sputnik over London says too-too-too
Over Paris ditto
Over Washington hah! hah! hah!
And Polaris says Whoobsk:
Dear whilom friend champing with the bad teeth of Rudaki
His laugh for the terns and the gulls fogdog
On The Hoe, Plymouth, England mimicked

Wants to keep his fat sickness a secret,

As to my saying we will bury you

Of Americans, literally to bury
Only this city one life would not be enough.

After lunch: 'Even an animal

Tho a Russian full of vodka
Could never reach the moon.
You are a nightingale ..
Singing it closes its eyes and hears nothing
And no one except itself,
Newsmen don't write anything

Eyes and they say God's dew.' Nikita,

G. says, Christian names? I haven't

To some aristocracy of defecation.
I lived it-and as in my sleep
He has read it all
With the giant scanner 30 years late(Never hurt to the friend's good night
Or thrived to the vines good nwrning)
But as in time it pays off
To see a tie between three ages
20,40 and 60
While the oldest knows only
That he has breathed
20 years more than the older
And 40 more than the younger,
Is as in Cuba's cane or with snake dance
twining down on Kishi
Or as the Mau Mau who cannot blench
Before miscegenation
Or as the Queen of British barmaids
Before the Jury of her Pee-ers, Call
Me Hebe, that means goddess of youth, Dears!
N at with a telephone in his clothes closet
So to be private on a line to his broker, in case the
margin
Drops the closeness of the walls and the door
Should sustain him.
-Keep up your bright swords,for the dew will rust them
God's nry lifo-snaring- no man can tell what.
- Look, if my gentle love be not rais'd up!
The gent's gone I've inherited his Times
Here read it yourself:
- Protesting a tax on horsetails for bows
M.P. was told '/ am glad he has
an interest in violins. / thought
he belonged to the wind

- Take it along it's tomorrow's.

The thought only the mist of life.
- Shall we walk the whole length while

- Wait long enough and

Who transported her harpsichord
On a sled lost in a storm
One night to play for Tolstoy, years
Before she used to be carried in blindfold
To all her concerts The horses find their way to the door.

On the streets like the hurdy-gurdies
Of 1910

No, let us not flatter ourselves ..

- They all have their radios and phonographs on.
If this street were made of records
People would break pieces off the walls
Of houses to play them.

For the music prize
With a claque of five thousand
Reinforced by half as many Roman athletes
To trigger the applause
Of an audience of one hundred thousand .. (Well)
Children are fond of stories

A monster concert .. at Dresden ..
1615 .. by command
Of the Elector of Saxony
One of my (Landowska's) compatriots
Raposki of Cracow ..

Brought from the Low Countries
(Breughel's spaces)
On a wagon drawn by eight mules
A counter-bass more than
Eight yards tall .. to reach its neck
Fitted .. a ladder .. (on a platform)
Many arms drew the huge bow.
This machine . . not enough for them
They conceived a counter-bass
An actual wind-mill
Strung with cables
Which four men vibrated
With a notched wooden beam.
Father Serapion worked
The great organ ..
A battery of mortars
Replaced the kettle drum.

And that a piece of coal,
I've the latter in my eye.
You cannot think illogically,
But the illogical is always logical:
Tape recorder- tape reason - is that my voice,
It is a philosophical-acoustical question
If anyone ever hears his own voice.
-Now I'm sleepy.
The lobby blares a hi-fi
As to an imagined giant anatomical
cast of inner ear
Tilted like Picasso's jeering horse's head in
His "Guernica."
In our corridor stand the lees of a milkfest
A dozen empty glass bottles
- Our neighbors'
Father and baby healthy
And before our own door
The paper, a letter, a postcard
The postcard from an old composer
Who teaches in his studioWhich is his homeAnd in his home,
Whose rare records not to mention limited
editions of scores his young friends
Borrow (and sometimes sell but never buy)
And who with a twinkle in his eye
Says he prefers a long word to a short So not twelve-tone,
"Duodecuple."

of the li'll ole

shoppe.
- Before Lunik Three
(the third)
Which is now nearer
The moon certainly
Than either to Moscow or New York
Choctaw oke or hoke equals yes.
And the history of the shoppeSay it was
With care, with care
My friend in a world where
Not all saints are friends
- What's tha-at!
- A diva singing six feet of uplift
The heIden soprano whose horse
Fell to the stage floor
When she leaned her elbow on it and
Stood on oblivious singing Brunhilde
(A true story.)
Man in the moon stand and stride
On his forked goad the burden he bears
It is a wonder that he does not slide,
For doubt lest he fall he shudders and sheers.
When the frost freezes much chill he bides
The thorns are keen to tear his tatters to shreds.
Is no one in the world knows when he sees,
No but it be the hedge, what weeds he wears.
Whither trusts this man what the way takes?
He has set one foot and his other before
For no behest he hastes can he see me nor move
He is the slowest man that was ever borne.
Where he was of the field and pitched stakes
In hope his thorns would stop up his doors
His twibill had other cuttings to make
Or all his day's work would be there forlorn.
This same man up high ere he was there
Where he was born and fed in the moon

289

[A-I3]

Leans on his fork as a grey friar
This crooked canard sore in his dread
It is many a day gone that he was here.
I know of his errand, he has not sped
He has hewn somewhere a burden of brier
Therefore some hayward has taken his pledge.
If the pledge is forfeit bring home the brush
Set forth thy other foot, stride over sty
We shall beg the hayward home to our house
And put him at ease for our mastery
Drink to him dearly of foul good booze
And our Dame Dowse shall sit by him
And when he is drunk as a drenched mouse
Then we'll redeem the pledge from the bailiff.
This man does not hear me tho I cry to him
I know the churl is deaf the Devil take him.
Tho I yell up high he will not hie
The lost lazy lout knows nothing of law.
Hop out Hubert in your hose magpie!
I know you are marshalled up to your craw
Tho I rage at him till my teeth are on edge
The churl will not down ere the day dawn.

The human son fathered by man and the sun sleeps
As with the sun sleeps nights, but the earth
Not quite the defense of "Still it does move"
Goes on in my heart. His motherThey go on in your heart. You sit
By and here's the Korean King who
In the first half century- the style is- 'of our Era'
Sailed his half-cylinder of bark from the mainland
('In Korean,' said the Methodist native, 'paulownia ,wood')
Skirted the rapids, landfall, and there turned it down
To dry and again over to string and play it
His harp in the isolation of his island;
As the child's half-size violin
Sounded thru the test in a wind tunnel.
Or as you may judge my Shakespeare theme- 'Love sees?'[A-13]

When love and eyes go together
Blessed, blessed reasonable idiotThe old spinet we have yet to buy
Mozart's dissonance, the dead season
That returns with four seasons.
It is with the world in our hearts
As it was with him as a child
When asked to roll up his shirt sleeves
To keep cool in the torrid heat
He refused yet under protest said
"All right, but remember it's cold."
Only in Shakespeare is there
Such reconcilement of the abstract and the actual.
It is in the earth of our hearts sometimes as in the world
As with old faces of soldiers in their teens whimpering
That tonight gone may bring peace to the ridge of
outpost Harry
T omorrow, the shell-fire's twenty-rounds a minute stop
For the dead buddy, its boot stuck out;
As with one wounded brought a cross
And asked did he recognize it, answered
"An instrument of torture."
And it is on earth as with you by me
Sometimes a foolish world but pleasant:
(- You needn't run up and down stairs
For what you forget so often,
I'll bring it to you
- That's all right for my new logic.
-'Batter up, Grumpa Marrump'
- Your idea of novelizing
The pernicious being
Of the little girl
Sounds interesting if
Not fascinating
You know how I feel
About some little ones. That was years before
The lyric poet made an art of violating.
Now as most anyone
Writes to play the bass drum

On everybody, and oneself
Seems the exception moved
By the intimacy of one response
There will have to be a
Redefinition of writing.
'An older sister an English beauty
Called Violet second name Wentworth,
Drawled Want-wart, with a young
Man piercing her brightly, I sell
Saddle leather- O then, stretched to t!zan,
You must be rich!'
- He used to talk about
His art and his God and his fiddle.
Then one day when he
Was supposed to play in Philly
We told the musicians he
Didn't hold a union card and
They walked out
So now him and his God
And his fiddle
Are in the local.Two hundred years ago
His alma mater
Under charter of the King
Set among the gravestones of Trinity,
A hundred years later
Moved to the site of the old
Deaf and Dumb Institution,
After expanded to the Heights
The library on ground
Formerly occupied by
Bloomingdale Insane Asylum.)
It is with earth as I saySeeing because tears are
Forbidden to these eyes,
Forget it tho I tell it to you
Say nothing to no one not even to me again
Unless some luck attends it
Then it will happen to you
Unlike the quartet

Of daily garbage collectors
Storming after
'Barrel E, Barrel A, Barrel D, Barrel G'
That you will be happy for the young
Who worded that foursome
String loose, and for his innocence
Careless not to understand we have aged.
Not to share with our age the same weakness
· . the commodity wages not with the danger
· . to live quietly and so give over.
· . sung, and made the night bed mute .. and
the lonely listener,
prose clothes the poem
· . world-without-end bargain in.
And take upon's ..
Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out
As if we were God's spies ..
If we didn't both like to talk
there would be scarce use in talking at all.
Less noise the fewness of three together
We age who will not suffer
The shame put upon youth
Naked an all-around bug on face of white rock
in the sea,
Asking with letters written on it, "Do you love?"
Come to that sea and air
The stars of their worlds
Looking at him with unconcerned eyes.
What brought it up ForgetM. said, whom I read
About at P's age, sixteen
To give an exhaustive
Account would need
A less brilliant pen than mine

Died of laughter, add the smile of
A dying they call civilization.

To have said unprovoked

To sixteen years rushing on seventeen
You can't win affection
By wishing your opponent to drop deadWhile the wish may be there
There is no defensePill-and-Envy
Mud's Son
All he has to do is to sit down
And he looks like Michelangelo's Moses
Preempted of the beard
By all future egalitariansPretends like his valet
The great know how to waitAiring his finds
Of painters who seek the greatest canvas coverage
For their slightest posterior temperatures
Their condescension too great a responsibility
For their itch to probe their heat itself
Not all cheeks pinched in public look red But they too perhaps may be said to feel the earth.
Had he said it to me - what answer?
An astronomer gazes at stars
Is it against nature as Inthehighest said
To sleep hy day and he awake at night
If one's trousers are subsidized out of the world.
Downcast because alive?
It could be simpler, granted.
As when the Catholic child
Saw the Infant in the creche
After the annual wait
The second Noel he remembered
- He doesn't seem to have grown any,
Who was his father, a carpenter,
Why doesn't he build him a bed?
Or as the architect
- You can get culture
If you will skip educationInterlocked his fingers
To illustrate reinforced concrete
And then made a pier and lintel

Of his old hands
To show where corners chip off.
Admitted, my modest philosophers No, common sense is not
What we find in the world,
Instead what we put into it,
Ourself lost in the things we make
Does His nth sense take care of them.
One swallow does not summer our nights
Calling up the hush of the new born baby brought
home after its mother's confinement
A shoot of plant grows a root on the ledge of
the kitchen sink
Times the rests you play solitaire
The visible paradise of the dying physical soul,
Vico's intellegere from legere to collect greens
The shock of first leaves their sibilance
The oldest story aching on love
Disserere to discuss to scatter seed,
You who will keep possessions to a minimum
- Bach, Mozart, Shakespeare-and most others
had no need to botherOnly the notes that see,
But for your pages you tore up
Of which I pasted the pieces
How else may we prove together
That the blindness of love was the eyes' refusal
To see what they let get by.
Opal to the fire of the sun
The small shell-like ears
That my heart knows will never be the world's wide
commonplace,
Constant in saving intention from wrath
Not a televised or radar heaven,
Their haven the opera- your song after 17 years
you know was
F or voices and lute.
Dian's argentine, simple unclouded thing
M .. m, night's mute, the slightest sound made with closed lips
The whole tale -

You are not to throw out your music
Grafted to the adequate,
Seen as the heart's beat for more hearing
Nothing stronger to displace it
The certainty which a third when revery
turns to talk must see.
Oh well say it lightly
- As he approaches six feet
His pants lose inches to increase the range
Of his mouth when talk opens it.
And you - you say to me - lover more like H. J.
As days track in days and their says
Grow more devious, all his girth
That accrued to him outwardly disappears inside you
As the great numbers to resignation
In every strike unfed, unclothed and unread,
Make no boast
As to Being everywhere - the table? the chair?
No not a thing. It pervades? 0, then,
a skunk,
They can't understand intellectuallarking.If I collect these things to live
It is that I think my eyes, ears and head are still good.
If I quote it is myself I have seen
Coming back to learn conveniently from one book:
It is not night when I do see your face.
Why so:
'I make my money by my hobby.'
His very honey is his lobby.
What do the well-off envious of us
Expect us to have done all these years, to stand still?
There was affection so affiuent
It used our lives for one long book thru all
our books,
Now their rivalry lives forever, why should
each grudge?
I paid taxes. "List all dependent on you for support:"
Me. "Relationship:" poet.
The blood's music repeats: "cellar door" (1926),
(1956) "Neither/nor, nor and/or"

Attesting an exchange between an intellective portion
Of head and that part it calls music
Meaning something some time to come back to a
second time,
As if there were shoes to cobble
I cobbled, my father was a cobbler,
Honor a word gone out of English
wove out of Bottom the weaver,
Richard Flecknoe on Pericles:
"Ars fonga, vita hrevis, as they say
But who inverts that saying made this play."
Was he saying it was a bore, or rather the opposite
That the life is longer than the brevity of its art.
The lines of the song Pericles that ends so many times: life.
Our thoughts . . ours . . their ends not our own,
As the eye looks to outlive its error.
And it is in the earth as in the auditorium of
Memphis - not Egypt- Tennessee:
An arena divided equally by a curtain
Into two amphitheatres,
In the one they stage wrestling matches, in
the other hold concertsOften together the same evening;
In the one spectators in the smoke of the third balcony
Are so dense they appear painted
Like Michelangelo's hordes of the Judgment
in the Sistine Chapel;
In the other perhaps the sarahand of
Bach's Second Partita for Violin Alone plays

'Only one thing revolves around A *** around a ***'3 stars around 3 starsBut his touch fails as it's coarse,

Has quickly turned over, breath
Evaporates so slowly
in tiniest droplets of mist
Night less it tells again
Your mother's story of the blacksmith shoeing
The horse, and the little frog lost in the stable
Toddles up one leg held up too for shoeing.
You who detest perfume read me of
Attar of roses banked as collateral in place of gold
1,100 Ibs of essence valued at $800 a poundThe Bulgarian rose the conquering Turk rode
Out of Persia- in the damp season rain intensifies
Their fragrance, the hot sun makes them grow faster
Than they can be picked, a harvest of roses before dawn
The second hour most of May thru early June
Twenty-five days
When the drivers of loaded carts ride embedded in blossoms,
Profusion 4000 Ibs of roses yield one Ib of essence.
The weight of the air is heavier than we are, and
By chance looking into the stereoscope I have picked up
Brings back our other summer:
TOURISTS, Hotel Moonglow, NiagaraNature has been kind, so
This is what they did to nature.
There come back not in the order of an itinerary
Jefferson's slave quarters in his natural air-conditioned
cellar at Monticello;
Washington's directly in his view from Mt. Vernon's portico
Prove him the less gadgeteer, the simpler founding father;
Magnolia and rhododendron: trees! The South's crepe myrtle,
The Collection's Amati they let him tryout in the Library of
Congress
Mimosa, blossomed mountain laurel, ArcangeloThe mad kept way out there in a circle as he playedCorelli, J annequin' s song
In the shadow of curtain behind curtain of trees
And then chased the birds. Travelled with
Western camellia, deodar
Tall trees and waterfalls
[A-13]

But falls and falls of tall trees
Douglas firs, redwood
A horseshoe promontory
White face of an animal or a peak
Twin of the white of Gilbert Stuart's
Portrait of Washington.
Oregon: Crater Lake saw
No order except its intense blue that
Clouds over it do not changeOther blue lakes clouds cover black.
Thoughtful eyes of landscape disinclined to die,
Sages of sheaves of analects
Who had lasted to taste trees grow,
Far from the misnamed temples
Of Grand Canyon's absurd sunsets
Evoking slaughter of Indians
In a burlesque of Indians.
The tourist emerald of Lake Louise
Set in the glacier,
Brown bear cubs on the porch of the one hotel
Paul called them kadota figs.
Canadian azaleas at the rail fences of the small town
Yellow Iceland poppies a sage might love,
An unnamed pink weed, some purpling by gray
And what they called for all of
A crest and crush of colors
poor man's flowers.
Fortunate to board a train with a drawing room: "A" Could our fathers see it what would they say
To its bright comforts of steel and chrome
Polished to look mild
As we looked out, on to Winnipeg,
At the soft mountains of Canmore
Thrown-up rocks, but traced with archaic noses
With ancient sisterly eyes in their faces
Green held, holds slanting up to them
So green a shade of gray
As tho a tree were painted path.
Smoke from a heap of leaves burning
Around a tree trunk

Rises thru morning sun in
Overhanging branches
So that its spring rays
Return on themselves
As spokes of smoke.
And with our early thought for dawn
This late hour the literal stereoscope
Has no use before our eyes' looks that blend
of themselves,
The human son and the sun sleep as tho
interchangeablyAnd you may remember how only a few years ago
You intended a small boy to light a masquerade
As a Chinese sage with blue whisk for beard
Shoe string for mustache and your black dress
For ceremonial robe. It is then
Not a world of four words - last things Not of a far-fetched fear that when the Chinese
Adopt the Latin alphabet
All language might be one.
For it is what each says exactly to each
That matters to us most Then the K'in plays its principles from nature,
Fields' earth, skies' round
Flat and dome
Length a ratio to a leap year
Thirteen studs, moons
Five strings of twisted silk ply of elements
Five notes planets from the lute pearMercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, Mars Yu-North's black winter water
Chiao-East's blue spring wood
Kung- Compass' center yellow prevails
over all four seasons' earth
Shang- West's white autumn metal
Chi- South's red summer fire.
So what if we don't know Chinese
Don't we become legend
Come back to read from one book
I do see your face-

The note Kung rules,
Shang ministers,
Chiao peoples,
Chi attends its state
Yu, to solid objects,
Dealing from a household
Each art deals from the structure
of its own houseEarth's yield and work
Use to the used
Evil's quelled, heart beats right
Desire mates tone:
Our bodies know more than our heads,
The windows open on music
The venetians stop rattling.
We talk after the fishermen in Pericles
Who banter their verse
Droll roll and gambol of a playful
fish of the playful seaShakespeare skeptical of most music
Considering the longest preparation of it turns out
fleeting.
This work shall live this night.
"He that doth ill hateth the night."
Only he; this night is courtly
Our own performance of Gagaku
A refinement so ancient it was never primitive
The dance makes space
(Not their ballet frittered thru it, frittering
it away)
The light shares it, sun
Tilled earth air
We they the old man and old woman dance
The Monkey Dance with white masks
(Able the sensible rhesus thrown into
that space
His reins neither Abel nor Cain)
They are a bit ridiculous?
Slits-eyes?
A disturbed music all the way to the sun.

Where? Everywhere. The air is around them.
There off-the mountain is peace.
The music is one note
The Monkey God comes down from
the mountain to watch. He stands still.
His face is his mask.
The Monkey is God
And seems to say
Don't scan
It is simple
To measure the dance
The foot up
Must come down
Unsaid appears said
And four feet standing together
In wish be raised
A lover's body turned as a phrase
And its multiples.
But clumsy
If you count and stress 10 in a row
You have also the time of 10 not stressed
Not seen
How does that work out as a system of 10.
Figure it out
But don't dance to stamp now
For those who will dance after you
Again.
The Monkey God stands still and appears to smile:
Stop rushing me to your graves
So that there appear instants
Between no word and no word
When there are gaps between things.
Should you never speak or step
You mean the same things to me.
Foolish to dare dance for all of a world
As for your killing chores to say
F or the beloved body that has not stayed
its mind,
When I die you can take over and rush ruins
the whole hog.

Do I hear your steps say together
If human life were a mountain or a flower
It could love itselfTho you are seeded
So the sun warms your bodies as one.
Your human son sleeps and does not care
That your steps say your three bodies are one.
Oldish man, frail, a
Yellow slip of paper
On which a song buds,
Wife who cannot always
Rush a song her way to say
I t was after all
not a bad life
Your eyes look at hands
lips seem to
touch.

Its decorations a corbie gable

Of the same soft stone
As the stone-scarfed
Ridiculous near-horse
A sagging bag of meatsNo art may divine
Why it's there
Unless it be honored
As some curious attempt
Of desire before it looks
Pulses and grows near.

As the happiness of a future life

we may hear without surprise

that .. at least the abuse of Christianity
had some influence on the decline

The clergy successfully

Mathematics, chemistry, mechanics,
architecture have been applied to the service of war;
and the adverse parties oppose to each other
the most elaborate modes of attack and defence.
Historians may indignantly observe
that the preparations of a siege

Should these speculations be found doubtful

I. The poet or philosopher illustrates his age and
country by the efforts of a single mind;
but these superior powers of reason or fancy
are rare and spontaneous productions;

2. The benefits of law and policy of trade
and manufactures, of arts and sciences
are more solid and permanent;
and many individuals may be qualified,
by education and discipline,
to promote, in their respective stations,
the interest of the community.
But this general order is the effect of skill and labour;
and the complex machinery may be decayed by time,
or injured by violence.
3. Fortunately for mankind,
the more useful, or at least more necessary arts,

or national subordination;
without the powers of one,

In a work most indigenously of these States, and beginning perhaps a
century of writing, as Wordsworth's preface of 1800 began it in England,
in Spring and All (1923) William Carlos Williams writes:
Crude symbolism is to associate emotions with natural phenomena,
such as anger with lightning, flowers with love; it goes further and
associates certain textures with ... It is typified by the use of the word
"like" or that "evocation" of the "image" which served us for a time.
Its abuse is apparent. The insignificant "image" may be "evoked" never
so ably and still mean nothing.
Sincerity and Ohjectification
... The principle of varying the stress of a regular meter and counting
the same number of syllables to the line .. . transferred from 'traditional'
to cadenced verse ... in Spring and All: not that [Williams] made each
line of a stanza or printed division carry absolutely the same number of
syllables- ... but there seems to have been a decided awareness of the
printed, as well as the quantitative, looseness of vers libre. Obviously,
what counts is quantity; print only emphasizes - yet, printing correctly,
a poet (Williams or Cummings) shows his salutary gift of quantity ...
one who has vicariously written, rather than painted as he has always
wished to do ... conscious of his own needs through the destruction of
the various isolated around him ...

THRONGS OF

VIETNAMESE PILGRIMS VISIT POND OF MIRACULOUS FISH .

'The pond is in Quang Nam about 30
miles west of Danang where hate between Buddhists
(about 80 per cent of the population) and
Roman Catholics equals "strong." The miracle happened about
two months ago in the middle of the crisis
the Buddhists accusing the Government of discriminating against
them. Word spread. A giant fish apparently a
carp swimming in a pond the incarnate Buddha.
The fish was so big and could be
seen so easily it was attracting the attention
of the villagers. From all over the province
Vietnamese came to the pond to be its
fish. At this point the district chief a
newly shrived Catholic told American aide that the
"pilgrimage" was an act of opposition. American decided
to clean out his pond. With new troops
from Col. Le Quang Tung's special forces both
marched to that pond to get that fish.
Troops fired their automatic weapons into their pond.
They placed ten mines in said pond and
set them off. They blew up and killed
everything in that pond except the fish. He
came on swimming. They started feeding it bread
so to tempt him up to the surface.
They followed bread with hand grenades pitched into
the water twice. Twice terrific explosions twice the
fish officially "continued" to swim. Ich hub dir

this weird and silly dream:
a swallow's nest, a monkey

then came down to me
asked to borrow a ladder.
I responded "by tl}eir example
Philomela and Procne engendered swallows" pleading "don't hurt my populace."
And the monkey fired ferociously
threatening all kind of evil
invoking justice. Somehow angered I
gripped her middle and looped
the monkey with her tail.

Pragmatic meaning equivocally fare well.

Some plants love wet: shore
trees color of roses, young

bark cracked, arbutus peeling, an
apple's animal faces. Rooted: felt
depth, density , core- distancing bare
ground the banyan roots from

shoots, roots again, no root
deeper than the sun's heat
reaches. A white fig mutates
to black, and the opposite
happens: replanted best with soil
it grew in or into
better. (Root cuttings below the
axil downwards!) Spines replace leaves,
the white poplars' turn their
under surfaces up and men
say 'summer goes' and as
leaves turn every which way
to the sun it's hardy

close to the twig. Engaged

LESSON

The Masque is centra ll y motivated by the drama. Each character .l l1m"s
in monologue, acting the complete seq ucnce of thc assigllcd role in , /riu,
Arise.
The metronome markings for the music determine the duration of cach
page for all the voices on each page. The speed a t which each voice speaks
is correlated to the tim e-space factor of the music. The words are NEVER
SUNG to the music. Dynamics are indica ted by type point size-( 141't =
loud ; 12 pt = moderate; 10 pt = soft) . Each voice shou ld come through
clearly. Performance time : approximately seventy minutes.
